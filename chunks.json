    "text": "3Dear shareholders, I am pleased to present to you, for the first time, the annual re- sult of Erste Group along with the outlook for the current year. 2024 was a very successful year fo r us. With a net profit of EUR 3,125 million, we posted an excellent result. We have achieved all of the goals we ha d revised upwards in the course of the year. Erste Group’s prov en business model and the focus on our seven core markets enabled us to generate organic lend-ing growth of nearly 5%. The in flow of customer deposits also remained steady, most importantl y from retail customers and SMEs. Our capital base continues to be strong, thus offering us strategic scope for capital allocation. Going forward, the first priority remains growth in our re gion, i.e. lending to retail cus- tomers and businesses. Before going into the details of our economic performance, let me briefly outline the economic environment. A year marked by subdued growth Our region saw a moderate recovery of the economy, yet eco-nomic performance was a mixed bag. Austria failed to meet ex-pectations and registered a mild recession for the second year in a row. In our CEE core m arkets, 2024 GDP growth rates ranged between 0.5% in Hungary and 3.9% in Serbia, supported mainly by household consumption. Labour markets remained robust despite the weakness of the economy. Inflation declined across all core markets and is now in the low to medium single digits, which has led to rate cuts in all markets. In 2024, the European Central Ba nk lowered its policy rate in four steps from 4.00% to 3.00% . Most of the CEE central banks likewise eased their monetary policies further. The central banks of Hungary and the Czech Republic had already started trimming their policy rates in the final quarter of 2023, while the central banks of Serbia and Romania followed suit only in the second and fourth quart ers of 2024, respectively. Excellent operating result What was the effect of these fundamentals on our result? The two most important income co mponents again posted growth: net interest income rose by 4.2% to EUR 7.5 billion and thus far beyond what had been forecast at the beginning of 2024. While all CEE markets registered growth – in Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Serbia, i.e. the markets outsi de the euro zone, even at double-digit rates – net interest income in Austria was down. It is worth noting that we were able to keep the net interest margin nearly stable in th e face of falling market inter- est rates. At the same time, ne t fee and commission income hit a record high at EUR 2.9 billion. The 11.3% rise is all the more remarkable as the baseline had already been elevated due to strong growth seen in previous years. Growth was achieved in all core markets, with particularly strong performance in pay-ment services and asset management. Overall, operating in-come came in"

The 11.3% rise is all the more remarkable as the baseline had already been elevated due to strong growth seen in previous years. Growth was achieved in all core markets, with particularly strong performance in pay-ment services and asset management. Overall, operating in-come came in at EUR 11.2 billion , almost 6% higher than in the previous year. Operating expenses increased by around 5% to EUR 5.3 billion, in line with expe ctations. Inflationary pressure had an impact on collective sa lary negotiations, most im- portantly in Austria. Personnel expenses were up at EUR 3.2 billion. The block of regulatory costs typica l of a bank (pay- ments to resolution funds and deposit insurance systems as well as banking and transaction taxes) amounted to some EUR 450 million in 2024. The strong operating result was re-flected in a cost/income ratio of 47.2%, which is excellent for our business model. Risk costs remain at a low level Asset quality was, overall, very good again in 2024, particularly in the retail customer business , due last but not least to low unemployment rates. Remarkab ly, the CEE core markets out- performed Austria for the first time. The NPL ratio rose mod-erately to 2.6% at year-end. Overall, (net) allocations to provi-sions amounted to EUR 397 milli on in 2024, which equals a provisioning ratio of 18 basis points of average gross customer loans. In addition to solid asset quality, another positive con-tribution came from the release of provisions for credit risks driven by updated forward-looking economic indicators (FLIs) and stage overlays. Healthy organic loan growth After a slow start in the first months of the year, demand for loans rose markedly towards the end of the year. Overall, net customer loan volume increased by 4.9% to EUR 218.1 billion. Growth momentum was seen acro ss the entire region, most no- tably in Austria, Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. Partic-ularly noteworthy was the budding recovery of the mortgage business in the Czech Republic and at Erste Bank Oesterreich. Corporate lending was likewise more dynamic in the fourth quarter than in the first nine months of 2024. Solid deposit base, low reli ance on money and capital market funding Deposit inflow continued, with customer deposits up by nearly 4%.

Because of our business model and solid market posi- tions in our core markets, Erste Group has a very large propor- tion (nearly 80%) of these hi ghly granular customer deposits. The central banks’ rate cuts, mo reover, slowed down the shift from demand deposits to term de posits. At the end of December 2024, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 90.2%. Similarly successful were fundin g activities in the capital mar- kets. Not only the parent compan y but also a number of local subsidiaries in CEE countries issued benchmark bonds in var- ious asset classes and placed these issues both locally and in-ternationally.

    "text": "4Solid capitalisation and dividend proposal Erste Group’s strong capitalisation is another point that I wish to highlight once again. Erste Group’s strong capital base and sustainable profitability are the preconditions for the bank’s fu- ture growth and ability to pay dividends and expand our scope of action. At 15.1% as of the end of December 2024, the com-mon equity tier 1 ratio (final) was again substantially above the regulatory minimum requiremen t and our target of 14%. For the 2024 fiscal year, the ma nagement board will propose a dividend of EUR 3.0 per share at the annual general meeting in line with our policy of distrib uting between 40 to 50% of net profit after the deduction of AT 1 dividends. In addition, after the successful completion of the second share buyback pro- gramme with a volume of EU R 500 million at year-end 2024, Erste Group is seeking to launch another such programme with a volume of EUR 700 million (subje ct to regulatory approval). Both the dividend and the shar e buyback programme were con- sidered in calculating the common equity tier 1 ratio. Sustainability and profitability are no contradiction Sustainability aspects have always been integral components of the strategy of Erste Group, wh ich is firmly embedded in the real economy. Where sustainability is concerned, the priorities defined are based on the convicti on that the green transition and social inclusion may have a positive impact on the long-term prosperity of our region. In 2024, Erste Group Bank AG integrated the sustainability statement into the management repo rt. This report uses the Eu- ropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as a frame- work along with the requirements of Article 8 of EU Regula-tion 2020/852 (EU Taxonomy). For further information on goals, emission reduction path ways and sustainability initia- tives of Erste Group, as well as a variety of ESG metrics, please refer to the management letter and our website. Outlook for 2025 In the current fiscal year of 2025, we expect solid loan growth of about 5% on the back of a moderate acceleration of economic growth, supported by both the re tail and the corporate business. This should help to keep net interest income stable. Net fee and commission income is projected to continue its pos- itive trend and increase by about 5%. Assuming a rise in operat- ing expenses (including expenses for strategic initiatives) by about 5%, we expect that we wi ll be able to achieve a cost/in- come ratio of less than 50%. Gi ven the stable environment, most notably in the CEE markets, we expect risk costs of approxi- mately 25 basis points in 2025. Th is should yield a continued solid return on tangible eq uity (ROTE) of around 15%. Proven business model & strategic initiatives Working with my management team, I have been leading Erste Group, one of the largest financ ial institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, since July 2024.

Th e focus of our employees in all of the seven core markets – Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Ro-mania, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia – has always been on the purpose of the business, which has remained unchanged since its foundation in 1819: creating and spreading prosperity. To en- sure that our busine ss model will remain relevant and success- ful in the future, we are workin g on strategic initiatives. Our focus is on the continuing deve lopment of our brand identity, a wide range of topics relating to digitalisation and the commit- ment to consider M&A transactio ns in our region to comple- ment organic growth. Talking about digitalisation: across the group, nearly eleven million customers were using our digital platform George as of year-end 2024. The number of digital transactions has been ris-ing steadily. By now, more than ha lf of all retail business prod- ucts are already distributed digitally. Supported by technology, we are planning to offer our cu stomers broader access to finan- cial advice than has ever been feasible in the past. Progress is likewise being made in increasing efficiency through digitalisa-tion, i.e. by automating transa ctions and processes and using digital data analysis. It is of special importance to me to thank the employees of Erste Group for their personal commi tment.

    "text": "6Dear shareholders, Erste Group posted a str ong Group result for the 2024 fiscal year, which was underpinned by successful risk and cost manage-ment as well as robust performance in all core markets. This is all the more encouraging as an up turn in economic activity ap- pears to be still some way off, most notably in Austria. In line with Erste Group’s divi dend policy, it is proposed that the an- nual general meeting approve a dividend of EUR 3.00 per share for the 2024 fiscal year. Erste Group has been making furt her progress on its path to- wards digitalisation. The digital platform George has been de-veloped further to provide addi tional (service) offerings and functions designed to optimise interaction with customers. We want our customers to be able to look after their financial health even more effectively, either independently or with support from Erste Group employees, p articularly when it is about providing for the future. For some, it is just a buzz phrase, but for us, it is an obligation: focusing on customer needs. Erste Group owes its strong positi on, last but not least, to a proven strategy. This does not mean coming to a standstill, though. In the years ahead, it will be crucial to venture into new territory to meet customer expe ctations and needs even more effectively while also further en hancing the strengths of Erste Group. A modern digital banking experience will doubtless be essential in the future for the ba nk to be perceived as relevant also by the younger generation. New strategic initiatives ensure that Erste Group is able to expl oit the benefits of novel technol- ogies and artificial intelligence. Th e difference will still be made by competent, dedicated and emphatic staff who strive to gain our customers’ trust by dealing with them personally. You may also rest assured that in our acti vities we will also consider so- cial and ecological aspects. The solid capital base enabled Erste Group to launch another share buyback programme with a volume of EUR 500 million, which was successfully completed in November 2024. Overall, 10,398,524 shares were purchased and cance lled. In its third year, the employee share programme “WeShare by Erste Group” enjoyed a high level of acceptan ce in 2024, with 35,000 partici- pants across the Group. In tota l, employees received approxi- mately 1.2 million shares of Er ste Group Bank AG. This in- creased the share of voting rights of Erste Mitarbeiter- beteiligung Privatstiftung in Erste Group Bank AG by 0.29% to currently around 1.59%. 2024 saw changes on the management board. As already an-nounced in the previous year’s re port of the supervisory board, Willi Cernko resigned from his management board mandate early, as of 30 June 2024. As of 1 July 2024, Peter Bosek as- sumed the position of chairman of the management board. The other members of the management board were Ingo Bleier, Chief Corporates and Markets Officer, Stefan Dörfler, Chief Financial Officer,"

As of 1 July 2024, Maurizio Poletto also took on the duties of David O’Ma-hony as Chief Operating Officer following the latter’s departure from the management board as of 30 June 2024. With this experienced management board team headed by Pe-ter Bosek, Erste Group is excellent ly positioned to cope with the challenges that are posed by the ecological and digital transfor- mation as well as the economic and geopolitical environment. The supervisory board is looking forward to continuing work with this team to benefit from o pportunities as they arise in the years ahead, not least from the implementation of the new stra- tegic initiatives. At year-end 2024, Erste Group’s supervisory board consisted of eighteen members (twelve shareholder representatives elected by the shareholders and six em ployee representatives delegated by the employees’ council). The members of the supervisory board bring together extensive experience gained across a vari-ety of industries and come with a wide range of professional knowledge, international experien ce and practical expertise. As in the previous year, more women than men are currently hold-ing mandates (ten versus eight). The supervisory board also saw changes in 2024: András Simor resigned from his mandate as of 15 January 2024. In this con- text, the delegation of Jozef Pint er to the supervisory board was revoked as new employee represen tatives were de legated to the supervisory board on 16 Janu ary 2024. Maximilian Hardegg and Michèle F. Sutter-Rüdisser resigned from their mandates as of the end of the 2024 annual general meeting. Two members – Caroline Kuhnert and Walter Schuster – were newly elected to the supervisory board at the 2024 annual general meeting, and Elisabeth Krainer-Senger-Weiss and Michael Schuster were re-elected. I wish to thank all former supervisory board members most cor-dially for their dedication and co nstructive contributions to the work of the supervisory board. With their experience and ex- pertise, they contributed to th e development of Erste Group as a leading bank in the eastern part of the European Union. For further information"

In th e course of a total of 50 supervi- sory board and committee meetings, the management board promptly and comprehensively informed the supervisory board. This allowed us to act in accordance with the mandate laid down in the law, the articles of association and the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, as well as to ascertain the proper conduct of business. The financial statements (consisting of the balance sheet, in-come statement and notes) and the management report, as well as the consolidated financial statements and the group manage- ment report for 2024, we re audited by Sparkassen- Prüfungsverband, the legally ma ndated auditor, and by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH, the el ected supplementary auditor, and received an unqualified audi t opinion. Representatives of both auditors attended the fi nancial statements review meet- ings of the audit committee an d the supervisory board and pre- sented their comments on the au dits they had conducted. Based upon its own review, the supervisory board endorsed the find-ings of these audits and agreed to the proposal for appropriation of the profit of the 2024 fiscal year. PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH was also mandated with th e voluntary audit of the (con- solidated) corporate governance report for 2024. By resolution of the 2024 annual general meeting, Sparkassen- Prüfungsverband and PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH were moreover appointed as auditors of the sustainability statement in conformity with CSRD. The supervisory board has approv ed the financial statements, and these have thereby been duly endorsed in accordance with section 96 para 4 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). The management report, consolidated financial statements, group management re port (including the sustaina- bility statement) and the (conso lidated) corporate governance report have also been reviewed by the supervisory board and accepted on the basis of the audi t reports received by the super- visory board. Finally, the supervisory board thanks the management board as well as all employees of Erste Group: without their untiring ef-forts and their ambition to keep developing Erste Group further, the excellent results of the 2024 fi scal year would not have been possible. As I am leaving the supervisory board at the end of the 2025 annual general meeting, the report in hand is the last report of the supervisory board to Erste Group shareholders to which I have contributed. While serving as a member and as chairman of the supervisory board I have been able to take part in the de- velopment and growth of Erste Group.

    "text": "8Dear shareholders, The audit committee is one of seven committees established by the supervisory board. Its mandat e is derived from the law, the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and its rules of procedure. As of 31 December 2024, the audit commit- tee comprised five shareholder representatives and three mem- bers delegated by the employees’ council. In 2024, the audit committee met se ven times and, in addition, held one informal meeting to prepare the meeting on the audit of the (consolidated) financial statements. The meetings were attended by those management board members responsible for accounting, controlling and risk management as well as the representatives of Erste Group Ba nk AG’s auditors and, as re- quired, representatives of the audi tors of material (foreign) sub- sidiaries. The appropriate division heads were invited to attend as permanent guests or to attend as guests in discussions on spe- cific agenda items. The chair of the audit committee and the financial expert regularly conducted one-on-one meetings with, amongst others, the auditors (S parkassen-Prüfungsverband as the legally mandated bank auditor and PwC as additional audi-tor elected by the annual general meeting), members of the management board, the head of internal audit, the chief com-pliance officer and, as required, with other division heads. The supervisory board was informed of the committee’s activities and the subject matters of its meetings and discussions at the respective subsequent su pervisory board meetings. For Erste Group, 2024 was a highly successful year despite the challenging environment. It was marked by several geopolitical conflicts, a sharp reversal in the rate cycle and a visible clouding of the economic environment. All this had an impact on the work of the audit committee an d was considered by the audit committee members with the required care and diligence in ex-ercising their duties. Amongst others, the supervisory board tasked the audit committee with reviewing the sustainability statement. In 2024, the audit committee specifically considered the follow-ing topics: after receipt of the auditors’ report on the (Group) financial statements for 2023, the audit committee held the fi- nal discussion, reviewed the (G roup) financial statements and the (Group) management report including the sustainability statement, as well as the (conso lidated) corporate governance report and recommended to the supervisory board the approval of the annual financial stateme nts and distribution of a divi- dend as proposed by the manage ment board. The additional re- port of the auditors pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 was taken note of. In connection with the sustainab ility statement conducted for the first time in 2024 in confor mity with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directiv e (CSRD), the audit committee recommended the supervisory boar d appoint an external audi- tor. The audit committee recommended appointing Spar-kassen-Prüfungsverband and PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as joint auditors, which were elected by the 31 st annual general meeting on 22 May 2024.

The audit committee periodically re-ceived reports on preparatory work done within the bank and also exchanged views with the au ditors on the audit of the sus- tainability statement several times. The head of the internal audit de partment reported on the audit subjects and material audit find ings for the year 2023 and, on an ongoing basis, about audit-re levant matters in the Group. The effectiveness of the AML compliance function was acknowledged by the audit co mmittee, and a BCBS 239 (data quality management) report was issued. The audit committee continuously reviewed and monitored the independence of the auditors of the (consolidated) financial statements with a par- ticular focus on non-audit servic es rendered for Erste Group. The audit committee gave pre-a pproval to permissible non-au- dit services and received repo rts on their current status. Material audit matters relating to subsidiaries were likewise dis- cussed in depth and commented on with regard to their impact on the Group financial statements. In its additional function as audit committee of Erste Digital GmbH pursuant to Section 30g para 4a(3) GmbHG (Austrian Act on Limited Liability Compa-nies), it recommended the supe rvisory board of Erste Digital GmbH to advise the shareholder s’ meeting of Erste Digital GmbH to approve the annual fina ncial statements, give its con- sent to the management board’s proposal for the appropriation of profit and take note of the management report of the share-holders’ meeting of Erste Digital GmbH. After on-site inspections conducte d by supervisory authorities, the audit committee took note of the respective audit reports and the plan to address the supe rvisory authorities’ findings and, where necessary, requested to be briefed on the current sta- tus of implementation. The joint supervisory team of the regu- latory authorities was informed about the audit committee’s work in a meeting with the chair of the audit committee and the chair of the supervisory board. Further information on the activities of the audit committee and its composition is contained in the (consolidated) corporate governance report prepared by the management board and re-viewed by the supervisory board.

    "text": "9After the strong gains recorded in the previous year, interna- tional equity markets continue d their upward trends in 2024 amid the impacts of geopolitical events, interest rate policies, inflation development and econom ic activity. Equity markets’ performance was supported by expe ctations of falling interest rates, which were met by the central banks in the course of the year. Continued strong demand for technology shares (buzzword: artificial intelligence) provided an extra boost. At the same time, market volatility was fuelled by mixed macroe- conomic conditions in Europe and China, as well as concerns about an economic downturn, geopolitical crises and uncer- tainty regarding potential shifts in the political environment in Europe and the US. Finally, market performance was also driven significantly by rate cuts implemented by European and US central banks as well as the announcement of fiscal policy stimuli in China. Most of th e indices covered again posted marked gains. EQUITY MARKET REVIEW Turnaround in monetary policies The central banks’ restrictive rate policies and the series of rate hikes designed to curb inflatio n rates that had reached record levels in 2022 proved effective. Inflation was moving towards the 2% target rate, and the ma jor central banks maintained a wait-and-see approach at the beginning of the year regarding a possible end to the rate cycle and held on to their policy rate levels for the time being. Their focus was on inflation momen-tum, the economy and the labour market. After a number of national central banks had alread y started to ease their mone- tary policies, the European Central Bank (ECB) carried out its first policy rate cut since 2019 in June. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) followed suit in September. Both central banks continued relaxing their monetary policies until year-end 2024, cutting rates in several steps. In Europe, the policy rate stood at 3% at year-end, while in the US the e ffective policy interest rate was set at a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. Global economic growth The global economy has proved resilient over the past years. Despite diverse developments in individual countries and sec- tors, global economic growth ha s remained stable while infla- tion has receded further at the sa me time. This resilience is ex- pected to continue. After 3.2% growth forecast for 2024, global GDP growth is expected to ru n at 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, while inflation should keep fall ing towards the central banks’ target levels. Growth prospects vary considerably by region. In the US, GDP growth is projected to come in at 2.8% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025 before slowing down to 2.1% in 2026. In the euro area, the recovery of real household incomes, robust labour markets and policy rate cuts will keep driving growth. In the euro area, GDP is forecast to grow by 0.8% in 2024, 1.0% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026.

The per- formance of Asian economies, most prominently China, will also continue to have a significant impact on global growth. Equity markets at record highs In the reporting period, growth was most pronounced in the US stock markets, whose performanc e benefited substantially from the strong growth mo mentum of US technology and AI-ori- ented companies. The boom was led first and foremost by the “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Appl e, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla), which account for more than 30% of the global market capitalisation of the S&P 500 Index. The performance of technology shares and the monetary policy turnaround started by the central banks was reflected in the performance of most equity markets and their ne w record highs, with the big- gest gains posted by the US indice s. As of the end of December, the NASDAQ Composite technology index was up 28.6% at 19,310.79 points. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 23.3% to 5,881.63 points in the year ended, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index broke through 40,000 points for the first time in 2024 and ended th e reporting period 12.9% higher at 42,544.22 points. In Europe, new highs were set by the Ger- man DAX index, which saw the ste epest rise, by 18.8%, the Brit- ish FTSE 100 and the Austrian ATX Total Return. The Stoxx Eu-rope 600 Index, which comprises the largest European equities, likewise hit a new record high in the course of the year and, at year-end, had advanced by 6.0%, reaching 507.62 points. In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 Index was up 19.2% while the Chinese CSI-300 Index gained 14.7%. Bank shares recorded further gains As in the previous year, banks were again among the favoured industries in 2024.

Moving in tandem with the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index, the Austrian Traded Index (ATX) was up 6.6% at year-end 2024, at 3,663.01 points. The ATX Total Return Index (including dividends) se t multiple new highs in the course of the ye ar and ended the year at 8,536.92 points, up 12.1%. This perfor mance was underpinned by the strong performance of the bank shares, which are heavily weighted in the index. The Erste Group share was among the top performers, having gained more than 60%. ERSTE GROUP SHARE Substantial gains After advancing by almost 23% in the previous year, the Erste Group share continued its uptrend in 2024 and gained a record 62.4%, with the steepest rise (by 21.1%) recorded in the fourth quarter. The closing price of EUR 59.66 on the last trading day also marked the highest closing price of the year, only slightly below the all-time high registere d in April 2007. The Erste Group share marked its 2024 low at EUR 36.46 on 3 January 2024. The key drivers of the remarkable growth in share value were primarily results that we re better than expected by the market and the upward revision of th e outlook during the year. Ana- lysts’ consensus estimates of 2024 to 2026 net profits moved higher. The Erste Group’s second share buyback programme, which was completed at year-e nd 2024, provided additional momentum. Investors placed their focus moreover on the out-look for lending growth, the development of the operating result, risk costs, return on tang ible equity (ROTE) and, last but not least, the priorities set by the new CEO Peter Bosek, includ-ing in particular the development of the digital banking busi-ness, growth (buzzword M&A) and capital distribution. Employee share programme In 2024, Erste Group employees again had the opportunity to buy Erste Group shares under the employee share programme. This programme was first offere d in 2022, and many employees took the opportunity to acquire Erse Group shares. In 2024, ap- proximately 35,000 employees took part in this programme. In 2022 it was 30,000, and in 2023 the number of participants was also some 35,000. The successful continuation of the employee share programme resulted in a further strengthening of Erste Mitarbeiterbeteiligung Privatsti ftung (Erste Employee Founda- tion), in which the voting righ ts of the shares acquired under the employee share programme are combined.

After the completi on of the first share buyback programme in the amount of EU R 300 million in February 2024, the annual general meeting of Erste Group decided on 22 May 2024 to carry out another share buyback programme in the amount of EUR 500 million based on the bank’s strong capital base.

The market capitalisation of Erste Group reached EUR 24.5 billion at year-end 2024 and was thus 55% higher than at year-end 2023 (EUR 15.8 billion). Erste Group is listed on the stock exchanges of Vienna, Prague and Bucharest. Its main stock ex change is Vienna, where in the year ended its trading volume av eraged 479,616 shares per day.

In addition, Erste Group has held prime status in the ISS ES G corporate ratings since 2018. MSCI has rated Erste Group with AA. In 2024, Erste Group par-ticipated in the CDP (Carbon Disc losure Project) rating for the third time; its sustainability me asures were affirmed at B. Dividend Erste Group’s dividend policy is guided by the bank’s profitabil- ity, growth outlook and capital requirements. We target a pay- out ratio in the range of 40-50% ba sed on reported net profit, net of AT1 coupons. The 31st annual general meeting that took place on 22 May 2024 resolved to distribute a dividend of EUR 2.70 per share for the 2023 fiscal year, which was paid out on 29 May 2024. For the 2024 fiscal year, the management is proposing a dividend of EUR 3.00 per share. RATINGS OF ERSTE GROUP BANK AG In late November, Standard & Poor’s upgraded Erste Group Bank AG’s outlook from stable to positive, confirming the A+/A-1 rating. It highlighted th e bank’s improved capitalisa- tion and solid results as well as the traditional strengths of the bank, namely funding and liquidity. Moody’s (A1/P-1) and Fitch (A/F1) left their ratings unchanged, each with a stable outlook. FUNDING ACTIVITIES In 2024, Erste Group again started the year early by issuing a EUR 1 billion, 7-year mortgage-covered bond (MS+50 bps), thereby opening up the covered bonds segment for European issuers. As investors’ appetite for longer tenors was gradually increasing, Erste Group decided to return to the capital markets as early as March 2024 by issuing another EUR 1 billion mort-gage-covered bond (9.75-year te nor, MS+55 bps). Just before the market environment started cl ouding in the weeks that fol- lowed, Erste Group placed a EUR 750 million perpNC2031 AT1 instrument (7% coupon, MS+440.7 bps) linked, as in the previ-ous year, with the repurchase of the outstanding AT1 instru- ment (5.125% perpNC2025).

Even though this transaction almost fully covered the funding volume required, Erste Group opportunistically issued another benchmark trans-action in the form of a EUR 750 million tier-2 bond (10.25NC5.25, MS+170 bps). INVESTOR RELATIONS Open and regular communication with investors and analysts In the year ended, the management and the investor relations team met with investors in a to tal of 274 one-on-one and group meetings. Questions raised by in vestors and analysts were an- swered both at events with in-p erson attendance and during tel- ephone or video conferences. The presentation of the 2023 an- nual result was followed by an analysts’ dinner and a road show day with investor meetings in London. Road shows were like-wise conducted in Europe and the US after the release of first and third-quarter results. Erste Group presented its perfor- mance and strategy against the backdrop of the current envi-ronment at international bankin g and investor conferences or- ganised by the Vienna Stock Exchange, Kepler, Morgan Stanley, RBI, UBS, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, mBank and Wood. 96 meetings were held to intensify the dialogue with bond investors.

To achieve this goal, we aim to support our retail, corporate and public sector customers in real ising their ambitions and ensur- ing financial health by offering excellent financial advice and solutions, lending re sponsibly and providing a safe harbour for deposits. As a competent and reliable partner for our customers and with our business activities anchored in the real economy for more than 200 years, we will continue to contribute to eco-nomic growth and financial stability and, thus, to the prosper-ity of our region. In all of our core markets in the eastern part of the European Union, we pursue a balanced business model focused on providing the best banking services to each of our customers. In this respect, digital innovati ons are playing an increasingly important and inclusive role. The sustainability of the business model is reflected in our abil- ity to fund customer loans by customer deposits, with most cus-tomer deposits being stable retail deposits. The sustainability of our strategy is reflected in long-term client trust, which under-pins strong market shares in almost all of our core markets. However, market leadership is not an end in itself. Market lead-ership creates value only when it goes hand in hand with posi-tive economies of scale and co ntributes to the long-term suc- cess of the company. The bankin g business, however, should not only be run profitably but sh ould also reflect its corporate responsibility towards all material stakeholders, in particular customers, employees, society and the environment. Therefore, we pursue the banking business in a socially responsible man- ner and aim to earn an adequate premium on the cost of capital. STRATEGY IN DETAIL The basis of our banking operatio ns is retail and corporate cus- tomer business in the eastern part of the European Union, in-cluding Austria. The capital markets and interbank activities, as well as public sector business, are defined more broadly to be able to meet our customers’ needs as effectively as possible. Long-standing tradition in customer banking Erste Group has been active in retail business since 1819. This is where the largest part of our capital is tied up, where we gen-erate most of our income and where we fund the overwhelming part of our core activities by drawing on our customers’ depos- its. Offering attractive, easy -to-understand products and ser- vices that meet the individual needs and objectives of bank cus-tomers is important in buildi ng and maintaining strong long- term customer relationships.

    "text": "14RETAIL BUSINESS Our key business is retail bu siness, and it represents our strength. It is our top priority when developing products such as modern digital banking that enable us to meet customers’ expectations more effectively. Our retail business covers the en tire spectrum from lending, deposit and investment products to current accounts and credit cards. Our core competence in retail banking has historical roots. In 1819, wealthy Viennese citizens donated funds to es- tablish Erste Group’s predecessor, the first savings bank in Cen- tral Europe. It was their aim to make basic banking services such as safe savings accounts and mortgage loans available to wide sections of the population. Today, we serve a total of more than 16.5 million customers in our markets and operate nearly 1,900 branches. Wealthy private clients, trusts and foundations are served by our private banking staff and benefit from ser-vices that are tailored to the needs of this target group. In addition, we use and promote digital distribution channels such as the Internet and mobile banking, not only to meet the increasing importance of digita l banking, but to actively shape the digital future. George plays an important role in this. Retail banking is attractive to us for a number of reasons: It of-fers a compelling busi ness case that is built on market leader- ship, an attractive risk-reward pr ofile and the principle of self- funding. In addition, it benefits from a comprehensive range of products that are simple and ea sy to understand and provide substantial cross-selling potentia l. We take advantage of these factors in all core markets and make the best use of our result- ing position of stren gth by pursuing a hybrid business model. In addition to the expansion of digital sales channels, the branch network remains an impo rtant component of the busi- ness strategy. Only a retail bank th at offers modern digital ser- vices and operates an extensive distribution network is able to offer tailor-made solutions and fund loans in local currency (e.g. housing financing) mainly from deposits made in the same cur- rency. Therefore, our retail ba nking model supports sustainable and deposit-funded growth even in economically more chal-lenging times. Another positive factor is the diversification of the retail business across countrie s that are at differing stages of economic development, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia. CORPORATE BUSINESS The second main business line, which also contributes signifi- cantly to our earnings, is bu siness with small and medium- sized enterprises, regional and multinational groups and real estate companies. Our goal is to enhance relationships with our clients beyond pure lending busi ness. Specifically, our goal is for SMEs and large corporate customers to choose Erste Group as their principal bank and also route their payment transfers through our banking entities and, in fact, regard Erste Group as their first point of contact for any kind of banking service.

This a pproach permits us to combine industry-specific and product ex pertise with an understanding of regional needs and the experience of our local customer re-lationship managers. In view of regulatory interventions, ad- vising and supporting corporate customers in capital market transactions is becoming increasingly important. CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESS Client-driven capital markets activities are also part of the com- prehensive portfolio of products an d services that we offer to our retail and corporate customers. The strategic significance of our centrally governed and locally rooted capital markets operations consists in supporting all other bu siness areas in their dealings with the capital markets and, he nce, in providing our customers with professional access to the fi nancial markets. We, therefore, view our capital markets business as a link between financial markets and our customers. As a key capital markets player in the region, we also perform impo rtant functions such as market making, capital market research and product structuring. Capital markets business serves the needs of our retail and cor- porate customers as well as those of government entities and fi-nancial institutions. Due to our strong network in the eastern part of the European Union, we have a thorough understanding of local markets and customer needs. In our capital markets business, too, we concentrate on core markets of retail, SME and large corporate business: Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia. For institutional cus- tomers, specialised teams have been established in Germany and Poland as well as in Hong Kong and New York that offer these customers a tailor-made range of products. In many countries where we operate, the local capital markets are not yet as highly developed as in Western Europe or the United States of America. That means our banking subsidiaries are pioneers in some of these markets. Therefore, building more efficient capital markets in the region is another strategic objective of our capital markets activities. PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS Solid deposit business is one"

PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS Solid deposit business is one of the key pillars of our business model. Customer deposits surpass lending volume in most of our geographic markets.

Our public sector customers are primarily municipalities, regional entities and sovereigns that we additionally support and"

In terms of sovereign bond investments, we focus on Central and Eastern Europe equally. Adequate transport and energy infrastructure and municipal services are absolutely key prer equisites for sustainable eco- nomic growth in the long term. Therefore, we view infrastruc-ture finance and all associated financial services to be of ex-treme importance. INTERBANK BUSINESS Interbank business is an integr al part of our business model that performs the strategic functi on of ensuring that the liquid- ity needs of our customer business are met. In particular, this involves short-term borrowing an d lending of liquid funds in the interbank market. CORE MARKETS IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION When Erste Group went public as an Austrian savings bank with no meaningful foreign pres ence in 1997, it defined its tar- get region as consisting of Austria and the part of Central and Eastern Europe that had realisti c prospects of joining the Eu- ropean Union. The aim was to benefit from the attractive growth prospects in these countries. Against the backdrop of emerging European integration and limited potential for growth in Austria, Erste Group acquired savings banks and fi- nancial institutions in countries adjacent to Austria from the late 1990s onwards. This part of Europe offered, and still offers, the best structural, and therefore long-term, growth prospects. Today, we have an extensive presence in the following core markets: Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Croatia – all of which are members of the Euro-pean Union. Following signific ant investments in our subsidi- aries, we hold considerable market positions in these countries. In Serbia, which has been granted European Union candidate status, we maintain a minor market presence, but one that may be expanded through acquisitions or organic growth as the country makes progress towards European Union integration. In addition to our core markets, we also hold direct and indirect majority and minority banking participations in Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzego vina and North Macedonia. LONG-TERM GROWTH TRENDS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE The economic catch-up process across the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the underlying convergence trend con-tinue. This is due, on the one hand, to the fact that the region has to make up for almost half a century of the shortfalls of the socialistic planned economy and, on the other hand, to the fact that banking activities were l argely non-existent during that time. With the exception of deposit-taking, modern banking services were largely unknown in these countries after the fall of communism. On the lending si de, this was due to high nom- inal and real interest rates and al so to disposable incomes that did not support household credit growth.

Economic growth, which te mporarily declined substan- tially in some countries in CEE following the economic and fi-nancial crisis, recovered again. Despite such economic slow-downs and potential temporary ne gative impacts on the bank- ing markets in Central and Eastern Europe, these factors will remain the driving force behind future development. Disposa-ble income has risen strongly on the back of growing gross do- mestic product. In addition, most countries of Central and Eastern Europe have human resour ces that are at least equiva- lent to those of Western European countries but do not need to struggle with the unaffordable costs of the Western welfare states in the long term and have labour markets that are con- siderably more flexible. These advantages are complemented by – on average – highly competitive export industries that ben-efit from wage costs that are low relative to workforce produc- tivity and from investor-frie ndly tax and welfare systems.

    "text": "16A comparison of per capita private debt levels in Central and Eastern Europe with those of ad vanced economies reveals that even today, an enormous gap exists between these markets. Countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but also Croatia and Hungary, are many years away from reaching Aus-trian or Western European levels of loans per capita; also in rel-ative terms, these countries diff er substantially regarding debt levels common in the West. The contrast to Serbia or Romania is even more pronounced – private debt levels, particularly household debt, are substantial ly lower than in the advanced economies. We firmly believe that credit expansion accompa-nied by economic growth in this region will prove to be a lasting trend rather than a short-term process that has already peaked. Over the coming 15 to 20 years, on average, the countries of the eastern part of the European Union are therefore expected to experience higher growth rates than the countries of Western Europe, even though periods of expansion may alternate with times of economic stagnation or even setbacks on this long-term path of sustainable growth. BUILDING ON A STRONG BRAND Just over 200 years ago, our fo unding fathers wrote: “No age, gender, social class, or nationality shall be excluded from the benefits that a savings bank offe rs every depositor.” With this founding principle – which was re volutionary at the time – Erste oesterreichische Spar-Casse contri buted substantially to the dis- semination of prosperity for all segments of the population across our region. Erste Group was founded to give everyone access to financial services and has developed into an institution that has an im-pact on the prosperity and, therefore, the future of a region. To-day, we are one of the largest banking groups and employers in Central and Eastern Europe. The trust that we and our local banks have enjoyed stems from the fact that we have truly been putting the founding principle into practice. A brand is a consistent promise. It is more than a logo – it is about the perception that people have when they think about or hear of an organisation, its products and its services. Brands have an important identification and differentiation function, which in turn determines wh ether a customer chooses one brand over another. Ultimately, companies with strong brands benefit from emotional relationsh ips with their customers. Only a few businesses were founded with the aspiration of achieving more than just making profit. We are one of these and have been benefitting from a high degree of brand awareness and trust-worthiness. Over the last years, we have transformed our brand communi-cation from being category- and product-driven to having a pur- pose-driven approach. To this end, we have established a Statement of Purpose as the main group-wide pillar of our brand communication: “Our region needs people who believe in themselves and a bank that believes in them.” More than 200 years ago, a succe ss story started that continues until the present day."

The saving s banks were founded on this basis of personal trust and the be lief in ideas, plans for the fu- ture and people’s capabilities and potential. Whether it is in an individual’s personal life, in a business start-up or a long-estab- lished enterprise, in business or in society at large – trust and confidence in the future, believ ing in oneself and others, the belief in ideas and entrepreneurship are the key prerequisites for personal growth and social well-being. Therefore, it is not products and services that mark the begin-ning of the relation ship between us and our customers but ideas, goals, needs, dreams and plans. It all starts with people who believe in their ability to attain prosperity and shape the future. The future is created by people who believe in them-selves and their ideas – th eir visions of the future. “Our region needs people who believe in themselves. And a bank that believes in them” is the key sentence that stands for the approach to which we have been firmly committed for more than 200 years. #believeinyourself is more than a lead narrative. It encourages people to pursue their aspirations, to create something, and embodies our pr omise to assist them along the way to financial health.

It is designed to provide customers with user-friendly and easy access to personalised products of Erste Group, i.e. products that are tailored to meet their specific needs. Appli- cation programming interfaces (A PIs) support a wide range of co-operation arrangements with fintechs, start-ups and even across industries and can, therefor e, help to open up new mar- kets and attract new customers. George is available to retail cus-tomers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Cro-atia and Hungary. It will be rolled out in Serbia in 2026. At pre-sent, George is being actively used by more than ten million cus-tomers. The portfolio of digitally available products and services is being constantly expanded. Customers can activate applica-tions via plug-ins and use them to manage their finances. George Business was developed to provide modern digital banking to our corporate customers as well. It was imple-mented in Austria in 2022 and in Romania in 2023. In the Czech Republic, the roll-out will be completed in 2025. Our aim is to offer all customer segmen ts across the group an outstand- ing digital user experience on a single platform. Intra-group, interdisciplinary te ams are developing innovative solutions and new, AI-supported interaction options in George. These currently include an upda ted ecosystem for securities trading as well as George Junior, a digital offering for children and their parents designed as a fi nancial solution that is attrac- tive for the entire family. George Junior already forms part of our digital product portfolio in Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. With George Open, we, for the first time, offer non-customers an opportunity to get to know our digital prod-ucts, services and the George user experience, which allows them to become a custome r whenever they wish. It is our unequivocal ambition to be the key contact for our cus- tomers at any time. This means that we must also continue to focus on the prerequisites in or der to meet this requirement.

FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY AND PROFITABILITY Acting responsibly and earning a premium on the cost of capi- tal is a key prerequisite for the long-term survival of any com-pany and the creation of value for customers, investors and em-ployees. Only a bank that operat es in a sustainable manner – balancing the social, ecological and economic consequences of its business activities – and prof itably can achieve the following: provide customers with produc ts and services that support them in achieving their financia l ambitions; deliver the foun- dation for share price appreciati on as well as dividend and cou- pon payments to investors; create a stable and rewarding work environment for employees and be a reliable contributor of tax revenues to society at large. The management board adopted a Statement of Purpose to re-affirm and state in more detail the purpose of Erste Group to promote and secure prosperity across the region. Building on this Statement of Purpose, a Code of Conduct defines binding rules of day-to-day business for employees and members of both the management and superv isory boards. At the same time, the Code of Conduct underlines that in pursuing our business activities, we value responsibility , respect and sustain- ability. The Code of Conduct is an important tool for preserving the reputation of Erste Group and strengthening stakeholder confidence. Sustainability in th is context means operating our core business both in a socially and environmentally responsi- ble manner and economically successfully. Through a combination of stable revenues, low loan loss provi-sions and cost efficiency, profits can be achieved on a long-term basis. This is helped by a stron g retail-based funding profile. When growth opportunities are elusive, as they will be from time to time, or the market environment is less favourable as a result of factors including high taxation, increased regulation or low interest rates, there will be a stronger focus on efficiency measures.

For us, social inclusion means mo re than providing financial ser- vices; it also includes financial li teracy, social banking, affordable housing and gender equality. We are convinced that a good socio- economic environment forms the basis for solid banking busi-ness and has a positive impact on our economic development. The strategic pillars of the green transition and social inclusion are supported by best-in-class governance. Our ESG strategy is anchored in the governing bodies, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. This en sures that our ESG strategy is established at all levels of the Group and comprehensively in-tegrated into the business processes. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Our comprehensive and forward- looking strategy aims to se- cure our position as a leading fi nancial institution in the east- ern part of the EU while addressing the challenges of rapidly changing market dynamics. It a ddresses significant global de- velopments, including economic shifts, demographic changes, technological advancements, geopolitical fragmentation, and climate change, to ensure sustainable growth and resilience even in the event of a different future. As part of our strategy, we focu s on five overarching objectives, designed to drive sustainable growth, improve customer expe- rience and strengthen operational excellence. These objectives emphasise the need for transformation, innovation, and effi-ciency while integratin g principles of susta inability to ensure the bank remains competitive and relevant in a rapidly chang-ing financial landscape. Strengthening a distinctive brand identity At the heart of Erste Group's strat egic goals is the creation of a unique and highly recognisable brand identity that resonates across its markets. We seek to differentiate ourselves from com- petitors in a financial sector th at is increasingly becoming com- moditised. This involves positi oning Erste Group as more than just a bank, focusing instead on being a trusted partner that un- derstands and meets the needs of its customers at every stage of their financial journey. To achieve this, we are committed to developing innovative and tailored products and services that cater to the specific de- mands of regional markets and address the needs and interests of our customers at an individu al level. This customer-first approach is not only designed to foster loyalty but also to build long-term relationship s by providing value that extends beyond conventional banking. Our strong branding initiatives will also reinforce our reputation as a forward-thinking and customer- focused financial institution. Providing access to financial expertise and financial advice to everyone We proactively empower every customer to improve their fi- nancial health. Modern technolo gies, particularly artificial in- telligence (AI), are at the core of our strategic objective to pro-vide everyone with access to fi nancial advice.

Importantly, these technolog-ical advancements will complement but not replace human in-teraction, ensuring that custo mers can still access personal support when needed.

We are committed to integrate sustainability and ESG principles and to improve financial literacy across our markets as a means of fostering informed decision-making on the part of our clients. Driving efficiency through digitisation A critical element of our transformation is our commitment to comprehensive digitisation. We plan to digitise all key pro- cesses across our operations, from customer-facing interactions to internal workflows, creating a more efficient and agile or- ganisation. This focus on end-to -end digital solutions will not only enhance the speed and convenience of banking for cus-tomers but also deliver signific ant cost savings and reduce op- erational risk through less manu al processes and improved op- erational efficiency.

This was mainly due to higher loan volumes an d higher interest income from debt securities. These effects we re partly compensated by lower interest income from cash balances at central banks and higher interest expenses on debt securities in issue. The net interest margin (calcula ted as the annualised sum of net interest income, dividend inco me and net result from equity method investments over average interest-bearing assets) re- mained nearly stable at 2.46% (2.50%). Net fee and commission income Growth was achieved across all core markets and nearly all in-come categories.

The related valuation is shown in the fair value result, the valuation of corresponding hedges in the net trading result.Net trading result deteriorated to EUR 519 million (EUR 754 million) due to valuation effects resulting from interest rate de- velopments in the securities and derivatives business. Gains/losses from financial instr uments measured at fair value through profit or loss trended in the opposite direction and im- proved to EUR -82 million (EUR -306 million), primarily due to a decline in losses from the valuat ion of debt securities in issue at fair value.

Net allocations to provi-sions for loans and advances increased – most notably in Aus-tria – to EUR 394 million (EUR 264 million). Positive contribu- tions came from income from the recovery of loans already written off, primarily in Austria, in the amount of EUR 72 mil-lion (EUR 80 million). Allocations to provisions for loan com- mitments and financial guarante es amounted to EUR 54 mil- lion (net releases of EUR 70 million). Other operating result Other operating result is significantly affected by contribu-tions to resolution funds and taxes and levies on banking ac-tivities. Contributions to resolu tion funds declined in all mar- kets to EUR 28 million (EUR 113 million). The sharp decline is mainly due to the discontinuation of annual regular contri-butions from credit institutions in the euro zone in 2024. Taxes and levies on banking activities included in this line item rose to EUR 245 million (EUR 183 million). Thereof, EUR 40 million (EUR 46 million) were payable by Austrian entities. In Hungary, banking levies rose to a total of EUR 168 million (EUR 137 million): in addition to the regular Hungar-ian banking tax of EUR 22 millio n (EUR 17 million), a wind- fall tax based on the previous year’s net revenues was posted in the amount of EUR 52 million (EUR 48 million). The finan- cial transaction tax amounted to EUR 91 million (EUR 71 mil- lion). In Romania, the newly introduced banking tax amounted to EUR 37 million. The Austrian entities posted al- locations of EUR 102 million to a provision relating to the in-terbank exemption pursuant to Art 6 sec 1 subsec 28 (2nd sen-tence) Austrian VAT Act. This exemption might be classified by the European Court of Just ice or the EU Commission as incompatible with EU law and may have to be refunded. The balance of allocations/releases of other provisions amounted to EUR 23 million (EUR -23 million). Net result Taxes on income amounted to EUR 1,053 million (EUR 874 million). The decline in the mi nority charge to EUR 819 million (EUR 923 million) was attributable to lower profitability at the savings banks.

Total risk – risk-weighted assets including credit, market and operational risk (CRR final) – increased to EUR 159.1 billion (EUR 146.5 billion). The total capital ratio, total eligible qualifying capital in relation to total risk (CRR final), stood at 19.5% (19.9%), well above the legal minimum requirement. The ti er 1 ratio was 16.8% (17.3%), the common equity tier 1 ratio 15.1% (15.7%) (both ratios CRR final). OUTLOOK Erste Group’s goal for 2025 is to achieve a return on tangible equity (ROTE) of about 15%. This ambition is built on the fol- lowing key assumptions: Firstl y, the macroeconomic environ- ment, primarily as measured by real GDP growth, in Erste Group’s seven core markets (Au stria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia) remains robust and on average, improves moderately versus 2024. Consequently, Erste Group expects robust loan grow th of about 5% in 2025, sup- ported by growth in the retail as well as the corporate business. Secondly, operating performance as defined by operating result to stay broadly stable versus 2024, as net interest income is projected to remain flat year -on-year, fee and commission in- come continues to grow by about 5%, net trading and fair result produces a similar reve nue contribution as in 2024, and operat- ing expenses grow on the order of 5%. Consequently, the cost/income ratio is expected to be below 50%. Thirdly, risk costs increase only slightly to about 25 basis points of average customer loans from levels seen in 2024, as the asset quality en- vironment remains strong across Central and Eastern Europe while only deteriorating moderate ly in Austria. In addition, reg- ulatory costs, comprising deposit insurance and resolution fund contributions, banking levies such as banking and financial transaction taxes, as well as sect or-specific extra profit taxes, and the cost of supervision, in aggregate, are expected to in-crease due to an announced in creased banking tax in Austria. While a forecast for the other operating result, which is primar-ily impacted by regulatory co sts excluding deposit insurance contributions as well as extra prof it tax in Slovakia, and various categories of gains and losses from financial instruments not measured at fair value is challenging, this combined item is likely to stay flat versus 2024 in the absence of significant one-off effects. Assuming an effect ive group tax rate of about 21% and lower minority charges compared to 2024, all of the above should result in a retu rn on tangible equity of about 15% in 2025. In line with the projected stron g profit performance, the CET1 ratio is expected to increase in 2025, providing enhanced capital return and/or M&A flexibility. The adjusted net profit of 2024 (net profit after deduction of AT 1-dividends) allows Erste"

Potential risks to the guidance include (geo)political and eco-nomic (including monetary and fiscal policy impacts) develop-ments, regulatory measures as well as changes to the competi-tive environment. International (m ilitary) conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and in the Middl e East, do not impact Erste Group directly, as it has no operating presence in the regions involved. Indirect effects, such as financial markets volatility, sanctions-related knock-on effec ts, supply chain disruptions or the emergence of deposit insura nce or resolution cases cannot be ruled out, though.

Interviews with the CEOs of our local banks and board members of the Holding provide further insights into the respective business environment. The descriptions of the core markets are supplemented by financial and credit reviews. For more details, please see Note 1 Segment Reporting. Additional information is available in Excel format at https://www.erstegroup.com/en/investors/ reports/financial-reports. Operating income consists of net interest income, net fee and commission income, net trading re sult, gains/losses from finan- cial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, dividend income, net result fr om equity method investments and rental income from investment properties & other operating leases. The latter three listed items are not shown in the tables below. Net trading result and gains/losses from financial instru-ments measured at fair value th rough profit or loss are summa- rised under one position. Operating expenses correspond to the position general administrative expenses. Operating result is the net amount of operating income and operating expenses. Risk provisions for loans and receivable s are included in the position impairment result from financial instruments. Other result summarises the positions other op erating result and gains/losses from financial instruments not me asured at fair value through profit or loss, net. The cost/income ratio is calculated as operat-ing expenses in relation to operating income. The return on al-located capital is defined as the net result after tax/before minor- ities in relation to the average allocated capital. Austria Economic review Austria’s well-diversified, open and developed economy per-formed weaker than expected in 2024. After the recessionary environment in 2023 Austria’s economy continued to decline moderately. With the exception of public consumption, all com-ponents of GDP shrank moderate ly in 2024. Despite increasing real wages, private consumption remained subdued. High in- terest rates and still elevated en ergy costs continued to weigh on investments, especially in the construction and industry sec-tors. Industry was additionally ne gatively impacted by weak ex- port demand, especially from Ge rmany. On the positive side, the service sector continued to pr ove its resilience to the reces- sionary environment. Tourism boomed with the summer sea- son’s overnight stays at a record level. The agricultural sector, although not a major contributor to GDP, also performed well. Austria’s labour market remained strong with an unemploy-ment rate of 5.2%. Overall, the Austrian economy shrank by 0.7% in 2024, while GDP per capita amounted to EUR 53,600. Austria’s general government de ficit increased from 2.7% of GDP to 3.9%. The risi ng deficit was mainly due to higher ex- penses for public salaries, pensio ns and social benefits such as childcare and health.

Public debt as a percentage of GDP increased slightly to 79.7%. In 2024, inflation decreased further. Average inflation amounted to 2.9%, still above the EU average of 2.4%. Service prices, especially in the hospital ity industry, remained the main driver of inflation. Energy pric es, on the other hand, declined sharply, although from very high levels of the previous year. Core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, moderated to 3.9%. Austria’s monetary policy is set by the ECB, which cut the key policy rate of the monetary union from 4.00% to 3.00% in four steps during the year. All three major rating agencies affirmed Austria’s high credit ratings in 2024. Fitch maintained Austria’s long-term credit rat-ing of AA+ with a stable outl ook. In January 2025, though, Fitch revised its outlook to nega tive citing more complicated decision-making and higher fiscal risk due to political uncer- tainty. Standard & Poor’s kept its long-term credit rating of AA+ but improved its outlook from stabl e to positive. Moody’s left its credit rating unchanged at Aa1 with a stable outlook.

With total (domestic) assets of 143.8% of GDP, this metric is significantly higher than in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2024, the sector further strengthe ned its capitalisation levels and maintained a very solid fu nding base. Owing to the macro- economic developments, Austria’s banking market achieved only moderate lending and deposi t volume growth. On the as- set side, elevated interest rates, in particular in the first half of the year, and a relatively weak sentiment result ed in customer loan growth of only 0.7%. Desp ite the introduction of stamp duty exemption up to a property purchase amount of EUR 500,000, retail mortgage loan volu me shrank by 0.9%. The share of lending at variable interest rates continued to decline. Cor- porate loans grew by 1.6% mainly driven by financing needs for inventories and working capital. Despite higher cost of living, customer deposits increased by 4. 2%. Overall, the banking sys- tem’s loan-to-deposit ratio decr eased to 93.9% by year-end. Source: National Bank of Austria, Erste Group Stress test results, published annually by the Austrian National Bank, again confirmed the domestic banking sector’s adequate risk-bearing capacity. Funding and liquidity profiles remained strong. The Austrian banking sector ’s liquidity ratios were high and comfortably above minimum requirements. Macro-pru- dential measures for residential real estate financing remained unchanged. These regulations, issued by the Austrian Finan- cial Market Authority (FMA), include upper limits for loan-to- value ratios (90%), debt-servi ce-to-income ratios (40%) and a maximum tenor of 35 years. These thresholds were applied to new mortgage lending to households exceeding EUR 50,000 and visibly impacted new busine ss volumes.

Erste Group’s market share in the domestic as- set management business stood at 25.8%. George, Erste Group’s digital platform, continued to be very popular. The platform’s product range was again widene d, and the number of custom- ers using George grew by almost 200,000. At year-end, George posted 2.7 million users, and the digital sales ratio stood at 43%. ERSTE BANK OESTERREICH & SUBSIDIARIES Business review Interview with Gerda Holzinger-Burgstaller, CEO of Erste Bank Oesterreich How did the competitive environment change? In 2024, the market environment in Austria was again marked by challenging macroeconomic developments. The Austrian gross domestic product declined once again slightly while the number of business insolvencies was up substantially. The Eu- ropean Central Bank cut its policy rates in several steps to sup- port the recovery of the economy and encourage investment by both private households and businesses. In Austria, this objec-tive was not achieved fully: consumer spending remained sub-dued and lending to private househ olds declined in the first half of 2024 while corporate lending wa s stagnating. The second half of the year saw some improvement as the financing volume of financing, in particular lending to businesses, rose slightly. Fall- ing inflation coincided with a higher savings rate and, as a result, an increase in deposits. Pric e competition remained intense amid continued high banking density in Austria. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? Our efforts were concentrated on ensuring easy access to advi- sory services, which we offer all our customers at a high level of quality and by making use of innovative technologies. In 2024, the nation-wide roll-out of the Fi nancial Health Check, our per- sonalised advisory tool, was ag ain focused on the financial health of our customers. Workin g together with our customers, we develop solutions to shape their financial future. Having launched George FIT, we now o ffer our customers a digital ser- vice that shows them how to us e their money more effectively. We integrate insights from be havioural economics into our range of products and services with the aim of further enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing any obstacles to the use of our services that may still exist. Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? We were particularly pleased to be named Best Bank and Best Digital Bank in Austria in Euromoney’s 2024 Awards for Excel-lence.

Distinctions like these recognise our focus on customers, our long-term strategy and, of course, the work done by our em-ployees every day. With more th an 120,000 newly acquired retail customers in the Erste Bank Oest erreich & Subsidiaries segment, we could again continue the grow th-related success of previous years. For the first time, the numb er of retail customers in our portfolio reached an impressive level of 1.7 million. To be able to provide our customers with th e best possible advice and sup- port going forward, we are committed to the ongoing expansion and improvement of our products and services. In 2024, for ex- ample, we launched the Smart Savings functionality, enabling our retail customers to define and manage up to 10 savings goals at the same time, as well as th e new Business Credit Card for corporate customers. A challengin g event was clearly the cata- strophic flooding in September 2024. To help those affected quickly and without red tape, Er ste Bank provided an instant loan programme with a total volume of EUR 100 million. How did the cooperation with the savings banks develop, and what were the major achievements in this area? In 2024, the savings banks were – as was Erste Bank Oester- reich – able to steadily attract new customers. Their topic in the spotlight was securities. In the autumn of 2024, Erste Bank and the savings banks launched new securities accounts that are specially tailored to customer needs. They offer customised so-lutions for young people, heavy traders, online customers as well as for all those who occasionally need advice on invest-ments in securities at a branch office. In placing the focus on securities, we have increased transparency and significantly simplified the cost structure. The measures implemented are designed to not only attract pote ntial new customers but also to provide an attractive offer to existing customers. Initial feed- back has been very positive. In another step, options for access- ing data and trading securities in George were substantially ex-panded in the first quarter of 2025, which has taken the cus-tomer experience to an entirely new level.

Market research confirms that after the comple-tion of a Financial Health Chec k session, a higher level of cus- tomer satisfaction was achiev ed, and customers were more willing to recommend the bank than after routine sessions, which is evidence of the positi ve impact of this approach."

Net fee and commission income rose mainly on the back of higher payment and securities fees. Net trading re-sult and gains/losses from financial instruments at FVPL in-creased on valuation effects.

OTHER AUSTRIA Business review Interview with Ingo Bleier, Chief Corporates and Markets Officer How did the competitive environment change? CEE markets were shaped by the trend of falling interest rates throughout 2024. The lowering of euro rates in the second half followed earlier decreases in th e Czech Republic and Hungary. This development was accompanie d by a reduction in inflation rates during the year. However, despite lower rates and inflation, there was no imme- diate corresponding growth in investments across our markets. Demand for lending, driven by new investment projects, re-mained subdued throughout the year, which resulted in in-creased competition and pricing pressure among banks."

Thanks to our strong credit rati ngs, we benefited from very good institutional funding flows throughout the year. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? We continued our long-term digi talisation strategy centered around the George brand, with the corporate banking plat-form ”George Business” now rolle d out in Austria and Romania and with our first corporate customers on the platform in Czechia as well. The future direct ion of George Business will be shaped by a continuous develo pment of the platform, incorpo- rating new features based on customer feedback. Our strategy is to offer our business clients di gital services for all daily bank- ing needs in a very convenient , modern design. George Busi- ness also includes an online rati ng advisory tool informing our corporate clients about our rating view on them and offering improvement options. A strategy review initiated by our new CEO reaffirmed the core strategic importance of our financial health proposition. We further enhanced our correspo nding tool, named “Financial Health Zone”, by integrating pred ictive features and expanding the offer to our customers acro ss our region. The overall posi- tive customer feedback confirms the success of the journey we have embarked on. Erste Group Corporates & Markets has solidified its leading re-gional and, meanwhile also strong global position in the capital markets origination business built on product expertise, delivery, and execution capabilities, as well as profound research. Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? Global Capital recognised us in five categories: Best Syndicate Bank, Best Bank for Distribution, along with three individual awards for Best Syndicate Banker and two Rising Star trophies. For the fourth consecutive year , Erste Group has confirmed its position as the number 1 b ookrunner for CEE FIG unsecured issuances and number 4 globally for Euro Covered Bonds. Our Capital Markets activities have been further enriched by a stra- tegic partnership with the Baader Platform for equity research and sales activities, creating la rger investor access for our own activities in that area. In the corporate banking business, I am quite glad about the strong finish of the year where we caught up in loan growth and winning mandates from international corporates and public sector clients. Furthermore, the structural growth of our fee income through an expansion of our transaction banking and hedging activities for clients is highly noteworthy. The increase in primary client relationships is core to our str ategy and continues to work out well.

Net interest income decreased primarily due to a lower contri-bution of money market and inte rest rate derivatives business in Group Markets, and a non-re curring positive one-off in- come in the corporate portfolio of the Holding. Net fee and commission income improved mainly due to higher asset man-agement fees, as well as higher securities fees in Group Mar-kets and higher lending fees in the corporate business of the Holding. Net trading result and gains/losses from financial in-struments at FVPL improved on valuation effects. Operating expenses increased on the back of higher personnel, IT and project-related costs. Consequently , operating result as well as the cost/income ratio deterior ated. The impairment result from financial instruments deteriorated mostly due to the non-recurrence of last year’s signif icant release caused by rating upgrades and recoveries as we ll as muted NPL inflows. Other result deteriorated due to lowe r selling gains in Erste Group Immorent and the provision a ssociated with the interbank VAT exemption, only partially compensated by the discontin-uation of payments into the resolution fund in 2024 (EUR 8 million in 2023) and lower prov isions for other commitments in the corporate portfolio of the Holding. Overall, the net result attributable to owners of the parent declined. Credit risk The credit risk exposure in the Other Austria segment, almost completely related to Holding an d Erste Group Immorent busi- ness, rose substantially to EUR 65.9 billion (+14. 3%). Its share in Erste Group’s total credit ri sk exposure increased to 16.5% (15.8%). A large proportion of ri sk positions was related to se- curities and cash balances held with other banks. At EUR 23.7 billion, the share of loans to cu stomers in Erste Group’s total loan portfolio amounted to 10.7% (9.9%) and was significantly lower than its contribution to credit risk exposure. This in- crease in total loans to customer s was driven primarily by large corporates business. The NPL ratio increased to 2.1% (1.7%). Coverage of non-performing loans with loan loss provisions significantly decreased to 32.3% (54.0%), primarily due to the release of overlay provisions for certain industries. Czech Republic Economic review Economic performance in the Czech Republic remained sub-dued in 2024. Economic growth was mainly driven by house- hold consumption due to declining inflation, higher real wages and improved household sentiment.

As a result of a major consolidation package as of January 2024, the country’s budget deficit declined substantially to 2.9%. The consolidation package included a range of measures: On the ex-penditure side, cost-saving measures included significant reduc-tions of non-investment state subsidies, the expiration of energy costs mitigation measures, and a reduction of government sub-sidies to renewable energy source s. On the revenue side, the gov- ernment introduced various tax- related changes, such as reduc- tions in tax exemptions. At 43.5%, public debt as a percentage of GDP remained one of the lowest in the European Union. Infla-tion in the Czech Republic de clined significantly in 2024, mainly driven by lower energy and food prices. At 2.4%, it was one of the lowest in Central and Eastern Europe.

Customer loans grew by 5.3%. Retail loans increased by 5.9% due to a revival of demand for housing loans. Corporate loans grew by 5.1%, with euro-de-nominated investment-rel ated and working capital loans being key drivers. To support lending, the Czech National Bank (CNB) maintained its rules on mortgage business. There are no regula-tory limits for debt-to-income ratio and debt-service-to-income ratio for mortgage applicants. The upper limit on the loan-to-value ratio remained at 80%, and 90% for applicants below 36 years. In July 2024, the CNB decided to cut the counter-cyclical buffer from 2.0% to 1.25%. The systemic risk buffer rate was set at 0.5% as of 1 January 2025. The central bank’s annual stress test confirmed the resilience of the sector, highlighting high capitali-sation and robust profitability. Customer deposit inflows re-mained strong with a growth rate of 7.8%. Growth was more pro- nounced in the corporate business. At year-end, the banking sec- tor’s loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 63.5%, while the total capital ratio exceeded 20%.

Česká spo řitelna maintained its market leadership position in asset management pr oducts with a market share of 21.6%. George was the most used banking app on the market, both in terms of number of users and transaction volume. At year-end 2024, more th an 3.2 million of Česká spořitelna`s cus- tomers used George. The digital sales ratio increased from 43.4% in 2023 to 54.8% in 2024. Overall, Česká spořitelna’s market share in terms of total assets increased to 19.1%. Business review Interview with Tomáš Salomon, CEO of Česká spo řitelna How did the competitive environment change? The Czech National Bank had already started to change its monetary policy at the end of 2023, and in 2024, it reduced the 2-week repo rate in seven steps, ending the year at 4%. This de- cline in interest rates boosted le nding activity and prompted a shift in savings from deposit accounts to investments. Conse-quently, the mortgage market re bounded in 2024, supported by relaxed conditions for obtaining mortgage loans. The Czech Na-tional Bank abolished the bind ing limit for the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, leaving the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio as the only mandatory indicator for mortgage lenders. The LTV cap re-mains at 90% for applicants under 36 years of age and 80% for older clients. Additionally, an amendment to the Consumer Credit Act made early mortgage repayment less advantageous. This change led to heightened interest in secu ring new mortgages before the amendments took effect.

Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? In 2024, Česká spo řitelna achieved several significant mile- stones. The volume of housing loans, including mortgages and loans from the Bu řinka building society, exceeded CZK 500 bil- lion, while the total value of client investments under manage-ment surpassed CZK 400 billion. For the first time in its history , the open-end short-term bond mutual fund SPOROINVEST reached CZK 50 billion in client assets under management, becomi ng the largest mutual fund in the Czech Republic. In the corporate business, Česká spořitelna achieved another historic milestone, with the total volume of loans to corporate clients surpassing CZK 400 bill ion. This firmly cemented the bank’s position as the largest corporate bank in the country by financing volume. 2024 was also a year of awards and accolades. Česká spořitelna triumphed in major domestic co mpetitions, winning Bank of the Year, Best Bank, and the Gold en Crown awards. On the in- ternational stage, our bank was named the absolute winner in the prestigious Customer Centri city World Series Awards, com- peting against 150 companies from 38 countries. The bank’s in-novative focus on financial health – spanning strategy, digital so-lutions, and customer experience – was a key factor in its success. And, last but not least, in the global Qorus-Infosys Finacle Bank- ing Innovation Awards, Česká spořitelna secured the top honour for its strategic approach to enhancing customers' financial health, supported by the FIT Zone in George mobile banking."

Net interest income in the Czech Republic segment (comprising Česká spo řitelna Group) in- creased on the positive contri bution of lend ing business sup- ported by the newly acquired portfolios of Hellobank. The in-crease in net fee and commission income was mainly driven by higher securities fees. Net trad ing result and gains/losses from financial instruments at FVPL improved on positive valuation effects. Operating expenses in creased in FX-adjusted terms mainly due to higher personnel an d IT costs. Contributions to the deposit insurance fund decr eased to EUR 16 million (EUR 20 million). Overall, the operat ing result increased, and the cost/income ratio improved. Impairment result from financial instruments improved due to a parameter update (mainly af- fected by a review of the forward-looking information method-ology considered in PDs) and the non-recurrence of higher pro-visions related to the integration of the Sberbank portfolio last year. Other result improved on a lower contribution to the res-olution fund of EUR 20 million (EUR 32 million) and lower im-pairments of non-financial assets. These positive developments were partially offset by higher selling losses from bonds. Alto-gether, these developments led to a significant increase in the net result attributable to the owners of the parent.

In contrast to the previous year, househol d consumption increased impres- sively and proved to be the main growth driver. Despite rela- tively weak external demand, ex ports also contributed to eco- nomic growth. Investment activity, on the other hand, was neg-atively impacted by subdued private sector investments. Slo-vakia has been the world’s largest producer of cars per capita since 2007, with a total of almost one million vehicles in 2024. Slovakia’s labour market remained solid. The unemployment rate declined further to a historic low of 5.3%, driven by favour-able retirement conditions and a persisting structural shortage of qualified labour. GDP per ca pita amounted to EUR 23,600. Slovakia’s general government deficit increased further in 2024, driven largely by measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices. The combined budgetary cost of energy-related measures accounted for 1.0% of GDP in 2024. To mitigate the impact of substantial government spending, numerous measures, such as extra taxation of banks, an extend ed solidarity tax on excess oil profits, higher alcohol and toba cco taxes, and reduced contribu- tion to the second pension pillar, were introduced. In addition, the parliament approved a consolidation package to reduce the deficit by 1 percentage point annually to 3% by 2027. The pack-age, amounting to EUR 2.7 billion, consists of a 3 percentage points increase in value-added taxes, a financial transaction tax, and higher corporate taxes. Overall, the general government def-icit increased to 6.0% of GDP. Sl ovakia`s public de bt as a percent- age of GDP increased slightly to 58.9%."

The gov-ernment decided to maintain its energy price regulation which kept energy prices for households at the level of the previous two years. In addition, food prices also decreased. Inflation of services, on the other hand, remained relatively high. Overall, average consumer price inflation amounted to 2.8%. Core infla-tionary pressures persisted in th e economy, largely driven by the strong labour market. Slovak ia adopted the euro in 2009. The ECB decreased its key policy rate of the monetary union from 4.00% to 3.00% in four steps in 2024. In December 2024, Moody’s downgr aded Slovakia’s credit rat- ing by one notch, from A2 to A3 and revised the outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s cited significant institutional chal-lenges amid heightened political tension and higher public debt.

In 2024, the Slovak government subsidised housing loan repay-ments up to a maximum of EU R 150 per month. Despite this measure, demand for housing loans was muted.

Source: National Bank of Slovakia, Erste Group Effective as of 1 January 2024, windfall taxes were introduced, and Slovak banks face one of th e highest tax burdens in the Eu- ropean Union. Banks had to pay a special tax of 30% of their pre-tax profits in 2024. The tax ra te is expected to decline by 5 percentage points annually until 2027 after which it will drop to 4.4% by 2028, in line with othe r regulated sectors. In addition, the Slovak government decided to introduce a financial trans-action tax as of April 2025. The tax will be paid by companies and self-employed individuals.

    "text": "36 Source: National Bank of Slovakia, Erste Group The three largest banks in Slovakia continued to control ap-proximately 65% of the country’s banking market. In terms of total assets, Slovenská sporite ľňa remained the country’s larg- est bank as it controlled more than one fifth of the country’s banking market. Slovenská sporite ľňa’s market shares in both customer loans and deposits amou nted to approximately 23%. Market shares were higher in the retail than in the corporate business. In retail bu siness, the bank’s market shares stood be- tween 25% and 28%. In addi tion, Slovenská sporite ľňa was the second largest asset manager in the country, with a market share of 21.5%. It also maintained its leadership position in dig- ital banking with almost 1.3 mi llion registered George users. Business review Interview with Peter Krutil, CEO of Slovenská sporite ľňa How did the competitive environment change? In 2024, the Slovak banking environment was shaped mainly by macroeconomic factors such as meagre economic growth, tight-ened monetary policy of the ECB and significant local bank levies. Nevertheless, demand for housing loans, which had previously been constrained by higher interest rates, began to pick up grad-ually with the first signs of cheaper mortgage rates. Demand for consumer loans remained relatively high throughout the year. The combination of an improved financial situation of house- holds, thanks to lower inflation and renewed real wage growth, and attractive offered rates on term deposits led to a significant increase in deposit growth compar ed with the previous year. Gov- ernment measures, however, namely higher taxation of the bank-ing sector, played a negative role in the sector’s profitability. The special levy on banks pushed the effective tax rate from 21% in 2023 to around 40% in 2024. Theref ore, despite an increase in the operating result, net profit of Slovak banks fell by 11%. Otherwise, competition has eased slightly, especially in housing loans. Clients are less willing to switch between banks just for a small improvement in interest rates. However, the situation could change quickly if challenger banks squeeze their margins once again, possibly triggering another wave of refinancing in the market. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? First of all, we remain committed to our vision of building and improving the financial health of our customers. The first im- plication is that we want to be as easily accessible as possible. Therefore, we continue our omni-channel approach. The client choses to access our services either through traditional chan- nels such as a branch or throug h digital solutions full of inno- vation.

Slovenská sporite ľňa has developed from an almost purely re- tail bank into a well-balanced universal bank with a market share of roughly a quarter in both retail and corporate loans. In the corporate segment, we have attracted businesses thanks to the excellent work of our relati onship managers, fast and trans- parent processes, and digital innovation. For example, Slov- enská sporite ľňa offers its corporate clients a free, unique and highly appreciated financial health analysis, which has already been used by more than 5,000 companies. Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? It may sound surprising, but I am really proud of our clients. Over the past few years, they have faced the pandemic, high in-flation, geopolitical uncertainty due to the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, and substa ntially higher interest rates. Despite these challenging conditions, they have managed to re-pay their debts on time keeping th e quality of our assets at high levels. I am also proud of ou r employees. Our customer-focused approach has enabled us to deliver solutions that have im-proved the financial health of our clients. Delivery excellence has always b een in our DNA, and in 2024, it brought several awards to Slovenská sporite ľňa, which con- firmed our leading position in the Slovak banking market. Slov-enská sporite ľňa was awarded the title of Bank of the Year 2024 in Slovakia by the renowned magazine The Banker.

Net fee and commi ssion income increased on the back of higher securities, payment and insurance brokerage fees. Net trading result and gains/losses from financial instru-ments at FVPL remained largely stable. Operating expenses in-creased mainly due to higher personnel and IT expenses. The contributions to the deposit in surance fund amounted to EUR 3 million (EUR 2 million). Operati ng result increased, and the cost/income ratio improved. Impairment result from financial instruments improved slightly, driven by a methodological change in retail risk parameter estimation, which was partially offset by higher defaults and rating downgrades in Corporate business. Other re sult remained largely stable as the selling losses for government bonds were compensated by the discon-tinuation of the payments into the resolution fund in 2024 (EUR 4 million in 2023) as the target level was reached and a release of legal provisions.

NPL coverage ratio decreased to 92.3% (101.7%). Romania Economic review In 2024, the Romanian economy grew moderately. The main contributor to economic growth was household consumption, which was boosted by the strong labour market and significant real wage growth. Net exports, on the other hand, contributed negatively due to weak extern al demand. Investment activity remained strong supported by infr astructure projects funded by the European Union. Inflows of EU funds from the regular Multiannual Financial Framework and NextGenerationEU amounted to EUR 7.2 billion in 2024. Agriculture had a rela- tively weak year due to a seve re draught. The unemployment rate decreased further to 5.3%, the lowest rate since 2019. Over-all, real GDP increased by 0.8% , GDP per capita amounted to EUR 18,800. At 8.3%, Romania’s budget deficit remained elevated. The higher-than-expected deficit reflected rapidly growing"

It also re flected slightly slower revenue growth due to weaker than expe cted economic activity. On the other hand, the government anno unced a set of fiscal consoli- dation measures including th e postponement of public pen- sions indexation and the phasing-o ut of a preferential wage tax for the construction, agriculture an d IT sectors. Public debt to GDP increased to 52.4%. Inflation decelerated significantl y but remained relatively high. In fact, Romania had one of the highest inflation rates among European Union countries. The weak agricultural performance kept food prices relatively high, while strong wage growth im-pacted service prices. Overall, average consumer price inflation amounted to 5.6%. The Romanian leu was stable against the euro and traded in a narrow range aro und 4.95 throughout the year. The National Bank of Romania cut the monetary policy rate by a total of 50 basis points in two steps in July and August 2024 and kept it unchanged at 6.50% fo r the remainder of the year due to fiscal uncertainties and the above-target inflation rate. As a result of large budget deficits, lack of credible fiscal con-solidation prospects and politica l uncertainty, Fitch revised Ro- mania’s outlook from stable to negative but kept the country’s credit rating at BBB. Standard & Poor’s took a similar action in January 2025, revising the sovere ign outlook from stable to neg- ative and maintaining the rating unchanged at BBB-. Moody’s rating was unchanged at Baa3 with a stable outlook.

Net interest income was supported by the interest rate environment and volume growth. Fee and commission in-come also rose, driven mainly by securities business and insur-ance-related fees. Expenses were impacted by elevated inflation. Banks continued to adjust their branch networks and workforce. The government introduced a new sectoral tax for financial institutions.

Following the purchase agreem ent signed in 2023, Banca Transilvania finalised the integration of OTP Bank’s Romanian subsidiary representing the fourth bank takeover by Banca Transilvania in less than a de cade, after Volksbank Romania, Bancpost and Idea Bank. Furthermore, following the strategic partnership announced earlier, UniCredit acquired a 90.1% stake in Alpha Bank Romania in November 2024. The acquisi-tion is projected to be complete d in the second half of 2025, cre- ating the third-largest banking gr oup in the country by total as- sets. Finally, Alior Bank exited the Romanian market after sell- ing part of its loan portfolio to Patria Bank. Banca Comercial ă Română (BCR) remained the second largest bank in the country both in terms of customer loans and depos-its. The bank’s customer loan m arket share stood at 14.0%. Its retail loan market share amount ed to 16.9%, while in the corpo- rate business it was 11.6%. In te rms of total assets Banca Comer- cială Română kept its second place in the country, with a mar- ket share of 13.7% as of Decemb er 2024. George, Erste Group`s digital banking platform, contin ued to be very popular. The number of customers using George grew to 2.2 million. Business review Interview with Sergiu Manea, CEO of Banca Comercial ă Română How did the competitive environment change? Economic growth continued, given the important contribution of households’ consumption against the backdrop of a strong rise in real wages, ongoing job creation in the private sector and flat-tish unemployment. The National Bank cut the policy rate twice by a total of 50 basis points to 6.50%. Since then, given the still high inflation and fiscal risks, the key rate remained unchanged. Non-government loans grew faster than in 2023, driven by simi- lar growth rates of the retail and corporate business. In the retail market, consumer loans rose considerably quicker than mort-gages due to strong demand and tough competition among banks. The NPL ratio remained low due to prudent lending and tight macroprudential policies. M&A deals continued in the Roma-nian banking sector, eventually leading to further consolidation. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? We scaled up our flagship free financial literacy programmes, reaching 1.8 million Romanian s through Money School, the largest corporate volunteering programme in the country, and Financial Coach.

In addition, we launched ZBOR , a two-million-euro investment in the largest ecosystem in Ro mania dedicated to youngsters aged 14-25. ZBOR is a transformative space providing access to financial education and life skills, combining seven physical hubs with dynamic informal ed ucation curricula. It also fea- tures a mentoring programme, dedicated competitions and a soon-to-be-launched online platform. George, our digital banking ecos ystem, embeds today over 330 functionalities. BCR marked a European premiere by launching the Visa+ functionality, offering simplified, faster and more se-cure money transfers between individuals by only using mobile phone numbers. Visa+ can be activated directly in George and has international coverage, making our customers the first in Europe to receive fast multi-currency transfers, irrespective of the card issuer. Furthermore, we introduced George SmartEU, a functionality for microenterprises with simplified access to in- formation on EU and national funding programmes. We launched our first BCR Xpert Casa excellence centre dedi-cated to promoting, granting an d processing housing loans, a project looking to redefine the mortgage lending experience in Romania. Additionally, we contributed to the introduction of BCR Roma- nia Purchasing Managers' Index by S&P Global.

Our retail campaign for client acquisition and activation was a major success, attracting 167,000 new customers. The cash loan, credit card and savings a ccount sales increased two-fold during the campaign and our m arket share for new cash loans doubled to 29%. In 2024, almost 90% of all retail products were sold digitally. We expanded our green loan portfolio with 700 million euros of green financing to both retail and corporate customers. Casa Mea Natura, a loan for energy-efficient dwellings, accounted for 70% of all new mortgage loans in 2024. We are also recognised as the main partner for renewable energy projects in Romania. Last year, we disbursed 550 million euros for energy projects, with over 320 million euros for green initiatives. Over 6,500 companies supporting more than 280,000 jobs received financ- ing from BCR. Consequently, we reached double-digit loan growth, our oper-ating result improved by almost 20%, and we achieved a record bottom line despite prudent risk provisioning, delivering a 21% return on equity. BCR is one of the most efficient banks in Ro-mania, with a cost/income rati o of 37%. Our people strategy stood out through Va lued@BCR, a new programme allowing our colleagues to customi se their benefits plan. In 2024, BCR’s “Financial Intell igence\" campaign won a Bronze EURO Effie in the “Best of Europe: Corporate Reputation” cate-gory. Locally, BCR was awarded a Gold Effie for Financial Ser-vices and a Silver Effie for Corporate Communication. Finally, we were Coldplay’s partner of choice for their concert in Romania due to shared values like social responsibility and sustainability.

    "text": "41Hungary Economic review In 2024, Hungary’s economy grew slightly, driven almost en- tirely by household consumption. Investments remained a drag on economic growth due to the postponement of public invest-ment projects, subdued inflow of European Union funds and a low level of business confidence. Exports did not contribute to economic growth either due to lower external demand. Agricul-ture performed weaker than in the previous year. Foreign direct investments were positively impact ed by China as Hungary be- came its top investment destination in CEE. China was also the second-largest importer to Hungary after Germany. One fourth of the country’s manufacturing ou tput was produced by various international car producers. In addition, Chinese electric vehi- cle manufacturer BYD is building a factory in Szeged, with pro-duction set to start in 2025. Hungary’s labour market remained tight. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 4.4%, low compared to many other European countries. Overall, real GDP increased by 0.5%, and GDP per ca pita amounted to EUR 21,500. Hungary’s general government deficit improved to 4.8% of GDP. Throughout the year, numerous fiscal consolidation measures were implemented, such as th e postponement of state invest- ments, adjustments of the banking levy and the prolongation of windfall tax for financial, energy and retail companies. Public expenditure was impacted by the continuation of various state subsidies for retail and corporate loan programmes, a 6% pen-sion increase, and a wage increa se of 32% for schoolteachers. Public debt to GDP increased slightly to 73.9%. Inflation in Hungary declined si gnificantly, driv en mainly by lower food and energy price increases. The latter continued to remain partially subsidised for households throughout 2024. Average consumer price inflation st ood at 3.7%, in line with the average CEE peer countries. The core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, increased by 4.6%. The Hungarian forint de-preciated 7% against the euro. The Hungarian National Bank began cutting its key policy rate already in the last quarter of 2023. In 2024, the national bank re duced the policy rate in eight steps from 10.75% to 6.50%. Fitch maintained the country’s long-term credit rating un-changed at BBB but improved its outlook from negative to sta- ble.

In the local currency, customer loans grew by 6.8% main ly driven by the retail busi- ness which increased by 9.4%. Reta il lending was mainly driven by housing loans, which expand ed by 13.0%. Consumer loans grew by 6.0%. Corporate loan gr owth amounted to 4.6% as de- mand for investment loans was mu ted. Various state subsidies and support programmes continued to play a significant role in the Hungarian lending market. In 2024, new programmes were introduced, such as a home reno vation subsidy. In addition, a zero-interest loan for young Hungarian blue-collar workers between the ages of 17 and 25 was launched at the beginning of 2025. Terms for the baby loan pr ogramme tightened, while ru- ral housing subsidies were kept unchanged. Customer deposits increased by 8. 4% in local currency, driven mainly by retail deposits, which grew by 11.2%. In addition, Pre- mium Hungarian State Securities (PMAP) played an important role. Despite a 13% social contri bution tax on income from pri- vate savings in addition to the 15% personal income tax, asset management products grew substantially. Overall, the banking system’s loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 72.2%."

    "text": "42 Source: Hungarian National Bank, Erste Group Profitability of the Hungarian banking sector was strong in 2024. Net interest income declined by 4.4% driven mainly by the lower interest rate environment. The government further ex- tended the interest rate cap for variable and fixed-rate residen- tial mortgages until 30 June 2025. According to this regulation the reference interest rate used for calculating interest may not exceed the rate that was in effect on 27 October 2021. In addi-tion, the voluntary interest rate cap for newly disbursed loans designed to support lending wa s also extended until 30 June 2025. Initially set at 8.5% in October 2023, the cap was lowered to 7.3% in January 2024. This measure aims to provide stability and predictability for mortgage borrowers. The Hungarian Na-tional Bank maintained the ma ndatory reserve requirement at 10%. Net fee and commission income, which grew by 17.4%, benefited significantly from asset management business. Ad- ministrative expenses remained under control, despite a sub- stantial increase in personnel expenses. The number of branches decreased further. Asset quality developed favourably, and risk costs were low. Source: Hungarian National Bank, Erste Group Banks continued to pay banking and transaction taxes. The lat- ter was increased as of July 2024 and additionally, a new sup- plementary financial transaction tax was introduced for foreign exchange transactions. The windfall tax, which was originally implemented for 2022 and 2023, was extended to 2024 and 2025. Applicable tax rates and possibili ties for reductions were modi- fied. The Hungarian National Bank maintained the countercy-clical capital buffer at 0.5% thro ughout the year but decided to increase it to 1.0% as of 1 July 2025. Overall, the banking sector’s return on equity stood at 18.3% . The Hungarian banking sector continued to be well-capitalised, with a capital adequacy ratio of around 20%. Consolidation of the Hungarian banking market continued, and the number of banks decrea sed further to 39. In 2024, Hun- garian Banking Holding (MBH) completed the acquisition of Fundamenta-Lakaskassza Zrt. Gran it Bank went public in De- cember 2024, representing the largest IPO in Hungary in 25 years. As of 1 September 2024, the Hungarian National Bank launched Qvik, an electronic payment system that allows for quick, secure, and free paymen ts via QR code scanning, NFC- based touch, or clicking a link within a mobile application. The Hungarian banking market co ntinued to be dominated by OTP Bank, followed by MBH. Erste Bank Hungary remained one of the major market players in the country. Its market share in customer loans stood at 8.6%, with retail business remaining more dominant than corporate business. At 8.6%, the customer deposit market share remained almost unchanged. Erste Bank Hungary’s market share in asset management stood at 17.6%. The number of George users increased further and reached al-most 800,000 by the end of the year. At 6.3%, Erste Bank Hungary was the fourth-largest bank in the country in terms of total assets. Business review Interview with Radován Jelasity, CEO of Erste Bank"

The Hungarian banking market co ntinued to be dominated by OTP Bank, followed by MBH. Erste Bank Hungary remained one of the major market players in the country. Its market share in customer loans stood at 8.6%, with retail business remaining more dominant than corporate business. At 8.6%, the customer deposit market share remained almost unchanged. Erste Bank Hungary’s market share in asset management stood at 17.6%. The number of George users increased further and reached al-most 800,000 by the end of the year. At 6.3%, Erste Bank Hungary was the fourth-largest bank in the country in terms of total assets. Business review Interview with Radován Jelasity, CEO of Erste Bank Hungary How did the competitive environment change? 2024 was a challenging but succe ssful year for Erste Bank Hun- gary. The competitive environment underwent significant changes, although profitability remained relatively high. Cus- tomers’ demand for seamless serv ices increased further, high- lighting the rising need for services provided via mobile bank-ing. Retail loan activity picked up substantially despite only a modest decrease in interest rates. In response to a persistent in- flationary environment, customers continued shif ting their de- posits towards investments, prompting banks to focus even more on asset management products. The adoption of innovative tech nologies intensified competition within the industry. Artificial in telligence is anticipated to be a game-changer in the long run.

Due to increasing expense pre ssure and lower net interest in- come, banks have been facing a greater emphasis on efficiency. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? In 2024, Erste Bank Hungary disti nguished itself through sev- eral innovative initiatives that enhanced our customer satisfac- tion and solidified our leading position in the competitive bank-ing landscape. Our mobile-first approach empha sises the central role of George in our service delivery. Over 70% of our customers are now digitally active, with a continuously growing number ex-clusively using the George app. In digital finance, we put the focus on digital investment and savings products, introduced fintech solutions for currency tr ansfers, instant digital cards ready within an hour of application, event-triggered digital in-surances, instant cash loans and expanded digital services for micro business clients. To support financial health, besides investment tips and pen-sion advisory, we launched Geor ge Tips, offering personalised advice to maintain financial well-being and George FitZone for education and better financial management. Our commitment to data analytics and personal ad vice is evolving, with ongoing developments in real-time, transaction and trigger-based initia-tives. We equipped all of our over 3,000 employees with AI-based personal assistants to fu rther enhance productivity. Ad- ditionally, we published a fina ncial education storybook for children, underscoring our dedicati on to financial literacy start- ing already at a young age. Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? Our strategic focus on customer satisfaction, employee engage-ment and sustainable return on equity has paid off. We achieved outstanding results in these area s and were ranked among the top 10 employers in Hungary, the only bank in the top 20. In retail, alongside significan t customer acquisition, we ex- celled in Erste Group’s digital activation, which helps service the growing customer base agai nst the background of our streamlined physical presence. Over the year, we gradually ex-tended tablet-embedded George sales flows, covering most branch-sold products for savings, investments and insurance. In wealth management, we cons istently exceed 5,000 billion HUF with significant year-on-year growth of 20%. Erste Future Programme participants increase d by over 30%. Corporate new customer acquisition rose by 50 % year-on-year. Despite muted loan demand we achieved strong results in New Green Invest-ment and used the market stagnation to implement significant process improvements. Erste Hungary won a bronze award for its “Be Erste” bank switching campaign at the Effie Awards and received the gold prize at the HRKOMM Awards, re cognising our internal com- munication campaign, communication strategy, cultural efforts, and core values.

Net interest income in the Hun-gary segment (comprising Erste Bank Hungary Group) was positively impacted by lower in terest expenses on customer de- posits due to a change in the deposit structure. Net fee and commission income rose on hi gher securities and payment fees. Net trading result and gains/losses from financial instru-ments at FVPL declined due to valuation effects. Operating ex-penses increased due to higher personnel and IT expenses. The contributions to the deposit in surance fund amounted to EUR 8 million (EUR 5 million). Despit e the increase in the operat- ing result the cost/income ratio worsened marginally. Impair-ment result from financial inst ruments improved due to recov- eries and upgrades from the non-performing portfolio. The de-terioration of the other result was primarily driven by breakage costs related to intragroup transactions. Regulatory charges went up: the banking tax increa sed to EUR 76 million (EUR 66 million); it included the regu lar banking tax and a windfall profit tax of EUR 52 million (E UR 48 million). The financial transaction tax went up to EU R 92 million (EUR 71 million). The contribution to the resoluti on fund was stable at EUR 2 million. Lower impairments of non-financial assets contrib- uted positively. Overall, the net result attributable to the own- ers of the parent increased. Credit risk Credit risk exposure in the Hu ngary segment decreased to EUR 12.3 billion (-2.5%). This declin e was mainly attributable to a decline in corporate business. Lo ans to customers decreased to EUR 5.8 billion (-4.1%). The sh are of the Hungary segment in Erste Group’s total loans to custome rs slightly decreased to 2.6%. While loans in the retail segmen t increased to EUR 3.3 billion (+1.9%), loans to corporates de creased significantly to EUR 2.6 billion (-10.8%). Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans to customers improved sign ificantly to 1.9% (2.6%). The loan loss provision coverage of non-performing loans increased further to 123.2% (110.6%).

Croatia’s public finances rema ined sound in 2024 despite the increasing general government deficit. Expenses increased due to the introduction of a new pu blic wage act, higher pensions, and measures to mitigate the impact of declining but still ele-vated energy prices. Overall, Croa tia maintained its fiscal disci- pline with a general government deficit of 2.2% of GDP. Public debt as a percentage of GDP decreased further to 58.1%. Infla-tion declined significantly to 3.0%, one of the lowest levels in CEE, driven mainly by lower energy and food prices, while in-flation in the service industry, especially in tourism, remained high. As Croatia adopted the euro on 1 January 2023, its mone- tary policy was set by the European Central Bank which de-creased its key interest rate from 4.00% to 3.00% in four steps during the year. Acknowledging the positive ma croeconomic developments all three major rating agencies upgr aded their sovereign ratings in 2024. Fitch upgraded its long-term credit rating from BBB+ to A- and left is outlook at stable. Moody’s upgraded its rating from Baa2 to A3 with a positive outlook. Finally, Standard & Poor’s improved its credit rating from BBB+ to A- and kept its positive outlook."

All financial insti- tutions concluded the euro ad option-related adjustments to their IT systems and ATM networ ks during the reporting year. Customer loans increased by 5.9%, driven by retail loans, which rose by 11.5%. Demand for housing loans was relatively strong compared to other CEE countries. Despite the tailwind from the declining interest rate environm ent, corporate lending growth was muted at only 0.2%. Custome r deposit growth amounted to 5.8%. Retail deposits increased by 4.6%, and corporate deposits rose by 7.7%. The Croatian Nati onal Bank increased the coun- tercyclical capital buffer by 50 basi s points to 1.5% as of 30 June 2024. In 2024, there was no noteworthy consolidation in the Croatian banking sector. At year-end, the banking system’s loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 71.2%. Source: National Bank of Croatia, Erste Group The profitability of the Croatian banking sector increased fur- ther. Revenues, especially net in terest income, benefited signifi- cantly from the still high inte rest rate environment. Fee and commission income was significantly supported by asset man-agement business. Despite wage inflation, operating expenses remained under control, and the cost/income ratio decreased to 39.9%. Asset quality improved fu rther; the share of non-per- forming loans (NPL) as a percenta ge of gross loans declined to 2.4%, supported by favourable developments in both the corpo-rate and retail businesses.

    "text": "46Business review Interview with Christoph Schöfböck, CEO of Erste Bank Croatia How did the competitive environment change? Given the successful realisation of Croatia’s strategic goals – the entry into the euro zone and Schengen – and with OECD acces- sion (the only step left to comp lete its full positioning on the international scene) expected as early as 2026, the country con-tinued to fare well with rating agencies. Backed by macroeco-nomic fundamentals, such as above EU average GDP growth and imbalances remaining in check, we are happy to see Croa-tia for the first time being awarde d ‘A-‘ level equivalent rating by all three renowned rating agencies. Croatia has a strong po-sition on the international inve stment map. Therefore, a grow- ing interest of investors has been noticed, not only in the field of tourism but also in the ICT sector (N.B. information and communication technology), lo gistics, fast-moving consumer goods, the pharmaceutical indu stry and the segment of renew- able energy. The banking market saw no furt her consolidation in 2024, yet it continued to be highly compet itive. The profitability of the sector remained, strong with cost efficiency further improving, capital ratios remaining high, and NPL edging further down to historic lows. Household credit gr owth was in the double-digit region, mostly owing to consumer credit, which grew close to 15%. Housing loans increased just shy of 10% despite the ab-sence of state-subsidised scheme s in 2024. On the other side, corporate loans saw another soli d year with a growth rate in mid-single digits, as the easing rate environment created de-mand tailwinds. The exposure to the public sector largely stag- nated, reflecting a changing struc ture away from bilateral credit and shifting towards direct exposu re via securities holding. The deposit side also produced stead y growth in the mid-single dig- its, where the retail segment, despite the ongoing issuing activ-ity by the Ministry of Finance in the retail space, showed a mod- erate acceleration. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? We are pleased that we contin ued stable business trends and achieved positive financial resul ts in 2024. Total lending growth, with new lending volume up in retail and corporate business alike, upward trends in the use of our digital channels where we exceeded one million users in total, as well as stable growth of our deposit base and positive risk costs have further consoli- dated our position on the local market. With the integration of the card issuing part from Erste Card Club (ECC), we made a significant step towards the furt her improvement of the card operations business.

Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? In January 2024, we issued our inaugural green preferred senior bond on the international capital market. The EUR 400 million bond was issued under Erste Group’s Sustainable Finance Framework and is the first green bond issued by any issuer in the Republic of Croatia. This issue was printed to fulfil the MREL requirement (M inimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities). The funds ra ised further improved the diver- sification of our funding source s, while being used to promote green and sustainable investments and projects. By the respec- tive, in total eighth issue of bo nds of our bank in the domestic and international capital markets, we have once again con-firmed our position as the most active non-government bond issuer in Croatia. I am also proud of the fact that our bank re- ceived the prestigious “Best Private Bank” award from the highly regarded PWM/The Banker and Global Finance publica-tions, having been declared the leading private bank in Croatia.

    "text": "47Net interest income in the Croa tia segment (comprising Erste Bank Croatia Group) increased due to higher average interest rates, higher customer loan volu mes as well as higher income from securities. Net fee and commission income went up mainly on higher payment fees. Net trading result and gains/losses from financial instruments at FVPL remained largely stable. Operating expenses increased on the back of higher personnel, IT as well as legal and consultancy costs. The contribution to the deposit insu rance fund amounted to EUR 3 million (EUR 9 million). Despite the increase in the operating result the cost/income ratio wo rsened marginally. Impairment result from financial instrumen ts still benefited from net re- leases due to upgrades and recoveries from defaults, albeit at a lower level. The improvement of other result was mainly driven by lower selling losses from bonds and lower provisions for le-gal expenses. Overall, the net resu lt attributable to the owners of the parent remained stable, driven, among others, by an ad-ditional windfall tax in the amou nt of EUR 6 million booked in the taxes on the income line. Credit risk In the Croatia segment, credit ri sk exposure rose significantly to EUR 16.6 billion (+11.4%). Lo ans to customers increased to EUR 9.9 billion (+5.3%). The sh are of loans to customers of Erste Group’s total loans to custo mers remained stable at 4.5%.

The NPL coverage ratio based on loan loss provisions decreased to 94.2% (107.6%) as loan loss prov isions decreased with the in- creasing volume of loans to customers. Serbia Economic review In 2024, the Serbian economy ou tperformed the CEE average. Economic growth was mainly attributable to domestic demand, in particular househol d consumption, supported by a robust la- bour market and real wage gains. Investment activity remained strong in both the public and priv ate sectors. The inflow of for- eign direct investments, most notably to the manufacturing in-dustry, was substantial. Agricult ural output, on the other hand, was weak. The contribution of exports to economic growth was only moderate. External demand was relatively weak, driven by the slow growth of the country’s main tr ading partners, espe- cially Germany. Serbia’s unemployment rate decreased to 8.5%. Overall, real GDP increased by 3.9%, and GDP per capita amounted to EUR 12,600. Serbia maintained a sound fiscal stance, and its general govern- ment deficit decreased slightly. While revenues benefitted from booming domestic demand, expenses were significantly up by defence-related spending. Belgrade, Serbia’s capital, will host EXPO 2027, the first world exposition in the country. This event already required investments in 2024. Serbia’s general govern-ment deficit decreased to 2.0%.

Inflation, however, started to gradually rise again after bottoming in June. This was mainly due to higher services and housing pric es. Overall, average consumer prices increased by 4.6%, slightly above the central bank’s target range of 3% ± 1.5 percentage points. The Serbian dinar was again one of the most stable currencies in CEE, trading at around RSD 117 against the euro throughout the year. The Na- tional Bank of Serbia reduced the reference interest rate in three steps in June, July, and Se ptember by 25 basis points each, bringing it down to 5.75% by the end of the year. Rating agencies acknowledged Serbia’s favourable economic developments in 2024. Standard & Poor’s awarded the country with the agency’s first-ever investment grade credit rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. Fitch confirmed its BB+ rating and improved the outlook from stab le to positive. Moody’s con- firmed its long-term credit ratings of Ba2 and also improved its outlook from stable to positive."

In retail busi- ness, both consumer and mortgage lending grew significantly. Corporate loan growth was mainly attributable to working capi- tal loans. At 14.1%, customer deposit growth was even higher than that of customer loans an d equally distributed between re- tail and corporate businesses. Overall, the banking system’s loan to deposit ratio decreased further to 74.0%. Source: National Bank of Serbia, Erste Group In 2024, Serbia’s banking system co ntinued to be profitable. De- spite interest rate caps on mort gage loans, cash and consumer loans, overdrafts and credit card fees, the operating income of the banking sector grew substa ntially. Operating expenses in- creased only moderately despite rising personnel expenses. The number of branches decreased further. Digitalisation was boosted significantly due to the ba nks’ continuous efforts to mi- grate customers to digital channels. The number of digital users increased further. Asset qualit y trends remained favourable, with the sector non-performing loan ratio improving to 2.5%. Risk costs remained low. The National Bank of Serbia did not change the capital requirements throughout 2024 and kept the countercyclical buffer unchanged at 0%. At 21.9%, the banking system’s capital adequacy remain ed strong, and its return on equity improved to 20.2%.

    "text": "49Business review Interview with Jasna Terzi ć, CEO of Erste Bank Serbia How did the competitive environment change? In 2024, despite a downward trend in Euribor, interest rates re- mained high at 7 to 8%, which significantly impacted loan de-mand. As a result, the corporate loan book in Serbia grew by only around 2.5%. Many busine sses postponed borrowing, an- ticipating further rate cuts, wh ile some banks introduced lower fixed-rate loans, betting on falling market rates. At the same time, we observed significant ex cess liquidity on the liability side, leading to cheaper deposits. However, at Erste Bank Serbia, we saw only a modest 25 basis poin ts reduction in corporate in- terest expenses. The solid economic momentum from late 2023 continued into 2024, and Serbia achieved approx imately 4% real GDP growth, one of the best in the region. Decl ining inflation, a tight labour market, and rising wages have b oosted real disposable income and domestic spending. Additionally, strong public investments and continued foreign direct investments have supported growth. The growth contribution from the external balance de- clined slightly, as imports grew faster than exports. On the credit side, retail lending expanded, with cash loans growing at a double-digit rate , while the corporate business posted mid-single-digit growth as businesses awaited ECB and National Bank of Serbia monetary easing. Mortgage loans also saw strong growth, supported by the NBS interest rate cap. Importantly, Serbia achieved its first-ever investment-grade credit rating, BBB- from S&P, in 2024, while Fitch and Moody’s remain below investment grade but with positive outlooks. How did you manage to successfully differentiate your business activities from those of your competitors? At Erste Bank Serbia, our key differentiator has always been a strong client focus — rather th an simply selling products, we strive to provide real solutions ta ilored to customer needs. This approach has been well recognised, as reflected in our SME CXI index results confirming hi gh client satisfaction. Additionally, we have maintained a leading role in financing re-newable energy projects, setting ourselves apart through a strong commitment to sustainabilit y. Beyond financing, we ac- tively contribute to decarbonisation by improving our own en-ergy efficiency, reducing transp ort emissions, and fostering a culture of sustainability. This holistic approach has allowed us to significantly expand our gr een financing and strengthen our position as a market leader. Moreover, sustainability is em bedded in our retail banking strategy. By prioritising ESG prin ciples, we have introduced in- novative products such as green mortgages with better pricing, loans for housing associations, and energy-efficiency loans for home renovations. Our continuo us focus on customer experi- ence and responsible banking en sures that we remain among the top banks in Serbia when it comes to client satisfaction and sustainable financial solutions.

Looking back at the year, what major achievements or challenges were especially noteworthy? Looking back, we take pride in several major achievements that reaffirm our leadership in key areas. As a payment bank and one of the six issuer banks for Serbia’s largest corporate bond (EUR 900 million), we played a pivotal role in capital markets develop-ment. Our FX sales performance was another highlight, exceed-ing last year’s results by 37%. Erste Bank Serbia was the first bank in the country to sign an MREL-eligible loan with the In-ternational Finance Corporation in a volume of EUR 65 million. Our leadership in sustainability and ESG excellence was widely recognised. We became the first bank in Serbia to receive the ESG Leader 2024 award from PwC for our environmental strat-egy. The EBRD Gold Sustainability Award honoured us for pio-neering the first loan to a hous ing association, while we also earned the EBRD Certificate of Excellence for Environmental Innovation. Additionally, our commitment to sustainable fi- nance was reinforced through the CSP Programme (N.B. Certi-fied Sustainability Professional ) and the launch of Go Green. Beyond the environmental impact, we were recognised as the Most Inclusive Employer 2024 for our dedication to social re-sponsibility and named Sustain ability Champions 2024 for driv- ing climate action. These milestones reflect both our achievements and the ongo-ing challenge of driving meaningful change in an evolving fi-nancial landscape."

The Serbian Dinar (RSD) was large ly stable against the EUR com- pared to the same period of the last year. Net interest income in the Serbia segment (comprising Erste Bank Serbia Group) in-creased due to higher loan volumes and higher average interest rates. Net fee and commission in come increased mainly due to higher payment, documentary and insurance brokerage fees. The net trading result and gain s/losses from financial instru- ments at FVPL improved on a higher contribution of foreign currency transactions. Operating expenses rose mainly due to higher personnel expenses and depreciation. The contribution to the deposit insurance fund am ounted to EUR 6 million (EUR 5 million). Consequently, operating result increased, and the cost/income ratio improved sign ificantly. Impairment result from financial instruments remain ed stable. Other result im- proved on lower provisions for legal expenses. Overall, the net result attributable to owners of the parent increased. Credit risk Credit risk exposure in the Serbi a segment rose significantly to EUR 4.3 billion (+10.0%). Loans to customers increased to EUR 2.3 billion (+3.9%). Retail loans grew at a faster pace (+5.5%) than corporate loans (+2.3%). Non-performing loans improved slightly to 2.6% (2.7%) of total loans to customers. Loan loss pro-visions stood at 103.5% (108.8% ) of non-performing loans."

    "text": "1 COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE Since 2003 Erste Group Bank AG has been committed to com- plying with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Govern- ance (Austrian CCG – see www.corporate -governance.at) and hence to responsible and transparent corporate governance. In addition, the mana gement board adopted a Statement of Pur- pose in 2015. This statement states in more detail and reaffirms the purpose of Erste Group Bank AG to promote and secure prosperity throughout the region in which Erste Group is active. Building on this Statement of Purpose, a Code of Conduct defines binding rules for the day -to-day business. This Corporate Governance Report has been prepared in ac- cordance with sections 243c and 267b of the Austrian Commer- cial Code (UGB) and Rules 60 et seq. of the Austrian CCG and combines the corporate governance report of Erste Group Bank AG, the parent, and the consolidated corporate governance report in one single report. For the 2024 financial year, a sus- tainability statement has been prepared for Erste Group Bank AG for the first time in accordance with EU Directive 2022/2464, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Information on the total remuneration of individual members of the management board and the supervisory board and the principles governing the remuneration policy are disclosed in a separate remuneration report pursuant to section 78e Austrian Stock Corpor ation Act (AktG). In the 2024 financial year, Erste Group Bank AG complied with all L -Rules (Legal Requirements – mandatory legal norms) and R-Rules (Recommendations – these rules are more similar to recommendations; non -compliance does not need to be dis- closed or explained ) as well as – with three exceptions – all C - Rules (Comply -or-Explain – deviations are permitted, but must be described and explained) of the Austrian CCG. The permitted deviations were as follows: _ Pursuant to C -Rule 2 of the Austrian CCG, shares are to be construed in accordance with the principle of one share – one vote, i.e. the company may only issue shares that have one vote per share and no right to nominate members to the supervisory board. Under Erste Group Bank AG’s articles of association (Art. 15.1), the shareholder DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar -Casse Privatstiftung is, however, granted the right to nominate up to one third of the members of the supervisory board to be elected by the annua l general meeting as long as it is liable for all present and future liabilities of Erste Group Bank AG in case of its insolvency pursuant to section 92 para 9 of the Austrian Banking Act. The Privatstiftung has not exercised this right to date. _ Pursuant to C -Rule 27 CCG, care must be taken to ensure that , for the variable remuneration components for management board members, measurable performance criteria are being fixed in advance as well as maximum limits for amounts or as a percentage of the fixed remuneration components.

One deviation concerns the treatment of the deferred variable re- muneration for management board members of Erste Group Bank AG, the share -based portion of which is treated as a long -term incentive (LTI) in the form of performance share units (PSUs). The number of PSUs is initially calc ulated at the time of the granting and adjusted according to the average group performance at the end of the deferral period (vesting). The performance criteria used to measure group perfor- mance are defined by the supervisory board annually in advance, hence there are no fixed performance criteria for the duration of the deferral period. The approach chosen by Erste Group Bank AG corresponds, however, most closely to a risk - based variable remuneration that is in line with Erste Group’s long -term performance and regulatory requirements. More details can be found in the remuneration policy adopted by the annual general meeting of Erste Group Bank AG pursu- ant to section 78a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, see www.erstegroup.com/en/about -us/corpgov. _ Pursuant to C -Rule 52a of the Austrian CCG, the number of supervisory board members (without employees’ representa- tives) shall be ten at most. In 2024, the supervisory board of Erste Group Bank AG comprised up to thirteen members elected by the annual gene ral meeting. The deviation from C - Rule 52a of the Austrian CCG is due to the size of Erste Group and its market position in seven core markets in Central and Eastern Europe as well as to the fact that the supervisory board has to perform a multitude of fin ancial -market -related and prudential review and oversight duties. Moreover, the supervisory board must meet various criteria to comply with diversity requirements. CORPORATE CONSTITUTION Erste Group Bank AG is a stock corporation established under Austrian law and has a two -tier management system compris- ing a management board and a supervisory board.

The supervisory board members being shareholder rep- resentatives are elected by the annual general meeting of Erste Group Bank AG, with due regard to the right of nomination granted to shareholder DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar -Casse Privatstiftung under th e articles of association, which right was, however, not exercised in the 2024 financial year. The employ- ees’ council of Erste Group Bank AG has the right to nominate one employees’ representa tive for every two shareholder representatives to the supervisory board. If the number of shareholder representatives is an odd number, then one more member shall be nominated as an employees’ representative. COMPOSITION AND WORKING PROCEDURE OF THE CORPORATE BODIES Selection and assessment of members of corporate bodies The qualification requirements for members of the corporate bodies (management board and supervisory board) of Erste Group Bank AG are governed by the internal guidelines for the selection and assessment of members of the management and supervisory boards . These guidelines define the internal frame- work for the selection and assessment of members of the cor- porate bodies taking into account relevant national and EU le- gal provisions for banks and exchange -listed stock corporations such as section 5 para 1 nos 6 to 13 of the Austrian Banking Act, section 28a of the Austrian Banking Act, ESMA and EBA guide- lines for assessing the suitability of members of the manage- ment body and key function holders (EBA/GL/2021/06), the ESMA and EBA guidelines on internal governance pursuant to EU Directive 2019/2034 (EBA/GL/2021/05), the ECB's guide to fit and proper assessments as well as the FMA circular on the assessment of suitability of executive directors, non -executive directors and key function holders. The assessment of proposed and appointed members of corpo- rate bodies is based on the following criteria: personal reputa- tion, professional qualifications and required experience as well as potential conflicts of interest, independence, time availability, overall composition of the management or supervisory board and diversity. Continuing development of members of corporate bodies To maintain an appropriate level of professional qualification and continuing development of members of the corporate bodies, Erste Group regularly organises events and seminars for members of the management board and the supervisory board and enables them to participate in external training events. As part of the 2024 in -house training programme for members of the management board and the supervisory board, board members discussed and considered a wide range of topics with in-house and outside experts both individually and collectively within the res pective boards. Among the professional development and training events organised for the respective boards were the following high- lights: training sessions on ESG (“ESG: Regulatory Framework, Ratings and Investors’ Expectations”) and on the legal and his- toric foundations of savings banks as well as on inorganic growth and M&A strategie s for banks .

In addition, manage- ment board and supervisory board members attended an FMA webinar on “ sustainable finance for management and supervi- sory boards”. As part of ongoing security aw areness training events, management board members were trained in matters such as cyber defen ce, phishing and data theft. Management board members also took part in a workshop on disability awareness. In addition, multiple sessions of extensive fit and proper training were held for supervisory board members to deepen their understanding of supervisory architecture and the law on banking supervision. Attendance of professional meet- ings organised by Sparkassenverband also formed part of the training programme. The development of such e xpertise and skills is continued regularly (on subjects such as current legal developments, specifically in financial reporting and risk man- agement) by means of presentations given by r elevant depart- ments at management board and supervisory board meetings. In addition, a comprehensive on -boarding process was conducted with member s newly elected to the superviso ry board at the annual general meeting held on 22 May 202 4. Measures taken to avoid conflicts of interest Every year, the members of the supervisory board are obligated to consider the regulations of the Austrian CCG regarding conflicts of interest. Furthermore, members of the management and supervisory boards receive internal guidelines on how to deal with conflicts of interest that are brought to their attention. These internal guidelines are based on Article 83 of the ESMA and EBA guidelines for assessing the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders (EBA/GL/2021/06) and Chapter 3.3.2 of the ECB’s guide to fit and proper assessments as well as additional legal requirements (section 28 of the Austrian Banking Act, section 95 para 5 no 12 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, section 95a para 1 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act).

The nomination committee will subsequently decide whether the conflict of interest is material and what measures need to be taken (abstention from voting on resolu- tions, ban on attend ance at meetings, voting ban, changing the duties of the body concerned, termination of the mandate of the management board or supervisory board member concerned). The conflict of interest will be disclosed in the relevant bodies and, if required, to the s upervisory authority. In individual cases, the (potential) conflict of interest will be monitored by the Compliance function or Group Audit. Furthermore, new mem- bers of the management board and the supervisory board receive comprehensive information regarding the avoidance of conflicts of interest when taking up their board function. Directors and officers liability insurance Erste Group Bank AG has a directors and officers liability insurance. Unless otherwise provided by local law, the insur- ance policy covers former, current and future members of the management board or managing directors, of the supervisory board, of the administrative board and of the advisory board as well as senior manageme nt, holders of statutory powers of attorney (Prokuristen) and management staff of Erste Group Bank AG and the subsidiaries in which Erste Group Bank AG holds more than 50% of the shares or voting rights either directly or indirectly through one or more sub sidiaries.

    "text": "8 Mechanism for shareholders and employees to provide recommendations and direction to the supervisory board In accordance with the law and the articles of association, the employees’ council has the right to delegate one member to the supervisory board from among its ranks for every two supervi- sory board members elected by the annual general meeting (statutory o ne-third parity rule.) If the number of shareholder representatives is an odd number, then one more member is appointed as an employees’ representative. Independence of the supervisory board Pursuant to C -Rule 53 of the Austrian CCG, the majority of the members of the supervisory board elected by the annual general meeting or delegated by shareholders in accordance with the articles of association shall be independent of the com- pany and its management board. A member of the supervisory board is deemed to be independ- ent if such person does not have any business or personal relations with the company or its management that would constitute a material conflict of interest and, therefore, might influence the member’s conduct . The supervisory board adheres to the independence criteria guidelines as set out in Annex I of the Austrian CCG : _ The supervisory board member shall not have been a mem- ber of the management board or a managing employee of the company or a subsidiary of the company in the past five years . _ The supervisory board member shall not have or not have had in the past year any business relations with the company or a subsidiary of the company to an extent of significance for the supervisory board member. This shall also apply to business relations w ith companies in which the supervisory board member has a significant economic interest, but not to positions held in the Group’s corporate bodies. The approval of individual transactions by the supervisory board pursuant to L -Rule 48 does not automaticall y qualify the respective supervisory board member as not being independent. _ The supervisory board member shall not have served as auditor for the company or been involved in an audit or worked as an employee of the audit firm that audited the company in the past three years. _ The supervisory board member shall not serve as a manage- ment board member at another company in which a member of the company’s management board is a supervisory board member. _ The supervisory board member shall not serve on the supervi- sory board for more than 15 years. This shall not apply to members of the supervisory board that hold investments with a business interest or that represent the interests of such a shareholder. _ The supervisory board member shall not be a close family member (child, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt , sibling, niece, nephew) of a member of the management board or of persons holding one of the positions described in the points above. Based on the above criteria, all members of the supervisory board have declared their independence"

This shall not apply to members of the supervisory board that hold investments with a business interest or that represent the interests of such a shareholder. _ The supervisory board member shall not be a close family member (child, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt , sibling, niece, nephew) of a member of the management board or of persons holding one of the positions described in the points above. Based on the above criteria, all members of the supervisory board have declared their independence with the exception of Friedrich Rödler. Friedrich Rödler has been serving on the supervisory board for more than 15 years. No member of the supervisory board holds directly or indirectly more than 10% of the shares of Erste Group Bank AG. In 2024, two members of the supervisory board (Maximilian Hardegg until 6 May 2024 and Barbara Pichler) served on a managing body of DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar -Casse Priv atstiftung, which holds more than 10% of the shares of Erste Group Bank AG. Independence and membership in supervisory board committees C-Rule 53 of the Austrian CCG does not specify any separate independence criteria for committee members. In the table below, the definition of independence pursuant to section 63a para 4 of the Austrian Banking Act is therefore used for the audit committee, while the independence criteria pursuant to section 28a para 5b of the Austrian Banking Act are applied for the remuneration committee, the nomination committee and the risk committee. The proportion of inde- pendent members is only stated for the committees that must be established by law (nomination committee, audit committee, risk committee, remuneration committee). Employees’ representatives are not included in calculating the independence ratio for the supervisory board as a whole or for the committees. When calculating the gender quota pursuant to section 86 para 9 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), employees’ representatives are included, substitute members do not count."

    "text": "10 Self -evaluation of the supervisory board Pursuant to section 29 nos 6 and 7 of the Austrian Banking Act the nomination committee is tasked with assessing the struc- ture, size, composition and performance of the management board and the supervisory board (the respective committees) and submitting to the supervisory board proposals for changes, if required, as well as assessing the expertise, skills and experi- ence of both the management board and the supervisory board members as well as of each body in its entirety and reporting its findings to the supervisory board. It is noted in this context that in 2024 the nomination committee extensively considered the matters named in section 29 nos 6 and 7 of the Austrian Banking Act in the course of workshops held with an outside consultant. In addition, the expertise, skills and experience of supervisory board members as well as their collective suitability were assessed in vari ous meetings when such members were newly appointed or reappointed. Attendance of meetings, potential conflicts of interest of supervisory board and manage- ment board members and the number of man dates and second- ary activities were likewise discussed. The supervisory board is required to assess the efficiency of the supervisory board’s activities, specifically its organisation and working practices (self -evaluation) in accordance with C - Rule 36 of the Austrian C CG and to conduct a self -evaluation. The supervisory board conducted a series of workshops in which its members, with the support of an outside coach, discussed the increased demands to be met by the body as well as the changing environment, heightened expectations and increasing responsibil ities. Against this backdrop, relevant measures were identified that are expected to contribute to the continuing internal development of the supervisory board and its performance. Contracts subject to approval (C -Rule 49 Austrian CCG) No contracts have been entered into that would require approval pursuant to section 95 para 5 no 12 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.

The supervisory board moreover has the right, within its statutory remit, to tra nsfer decision -making powers to committees or to withdraw powers from the committees. Risk committee The tasks of the risk committee are governed in particular by section 39d para 2 of the Austrian Banking Act and the internal rules of the risk committee.

The supervisory board has delegated to the risk committee the right of consent to the granting of special statutory power of attorney (Prokura) or commercial power (Handlungsvollmacht) for all business operations. The tasks of the risk committee include the acknowledgement of reports on legal disputes. In addition, the risk committee is responsible for reviewing potential stress scenarios in order to assess how the bank’s risk profile reacts to external and internal events. The risk committee is also tasked with taking note of reports on activities relating to Erste Group’s resolution planning and resolvability. In 2024, the risk committee performed the outlined tasks in the course of its 17 meetings. In addition, a large number of reports were given on risk and compliance matters as well as about loans approved by the management board within its scope of authori ty. Detailed information was also provided about indi- vidual industries and their impacts on the risk strategy. Further items on the agenda were audits by supervisory authorities, internal risk models, risk development in individual countries and subsidiarie s as well as the development of the corporate workout portfolio in general and major workout cases in particular.

In 2024, Alexandra Habeler -Drabek served as Chief Risk Officer (CRO) on the management board of Erste Group Bank AG. As the number of board members was reduced from six to five as of 30 June 2024, the share of women on the management board of Erste Group Bank AG increased from 16.7% to 20%. Pursuant to section 86 para 7 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the supervisory board of Erste Group Ban k AG must in- clude at least 30 percent women and at least 30 percent men. At year -end 202 4, women represented 55.6% of Erste Group Bank AG’s supervisory board members (202 3: 50%; 2022: 45%, 2021: 38.9%). As of 31 December 202 4, the share of women in man- aging positions as defined in section 80 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act stood at 2 6.2% at Erste Group Bank AG. Erste Group Bank AG, Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG, Česká spořitelna, Slovenská sporiteľňa, Banca Comercială Română, Erste Ba nk Hungary, Erste Bank Croatia and Erste Bank Serbia have set themselves the goal to achieve a 30% share of the underrepresented gender on the management board and 33% in top management (board -1) in each institution by 2028.

PROMOTING DIVERSITY General information as well as details on diversity are provided in the sustainability statement . For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the Diversity and Inclusion Policy takes full account of the diversity concept applicable in appointing man- agement board and supervisory board members with regard to age, gender, education and professional career. In selecting pro- posed candidates for supervisory board mandates, the focus must be on a well -balanced composition of the board and diver- sity within the board in terms of educational background and professional expertise. Diversity must be observed in particular with regard to the representation of both genders and age structure. The interna- tional experience represented on the supervisory board by supervisory board members of different nationalities or persons with a long international track record is to be maintained. In addition, in assessing the qualifications, composition and independence of the supervisory board, the criteria defined by Erste Group Bank AG’s supervisory board pursuant to Rule 53 of the Austrian CCG must be taken into account. In setting up supervisory board committees, special care must be taken to ensure that each committee will always have adequate expertise as required for its work (e.g. the remuneration committee must have expert knowledge and practical experience in the area of"

EXTERNAL EVALUATION Under C -Rule 62 of the Austrian CCG, Erste Group Bank AG commissioned external evaluations of its compliance with the C-Rules of the Code of Corporate Governance at least once every three years, most recently for the 2023 fiscal year. All eval- uations reached the conclu sion that Erste Group Bank AG had met all requirements of the Code. Deviations from the C -Rules of the Code were described and explained. Summary reports on these evaluations are available on the website of Erste Group Bank AG. SHAREHOLDERS ’ RIGHTS It is noted that Erste Group Bank AG has no rights arising from its own shares. Neither a subsidiary nor a third party holding shares on behalf of Erste Group Bank AG or of a subsidiary may exercise its voting rights and its rights for subscription to thes e shares. Voting rights Each share of Erste Group Bank AG entitles its holder to one vote at the annual general meeting. In general, shareholders may pass resolutions at an annual general meeting by a simple majority of the votes cast or, in the event that the majority of the sha re capital present is required to approve a measure, by a simple majority of the share capital present, unless Austrian law or the articles of association require a qualified majority vote. The articles of association differ from the statutory majority requirements in three cases: first, the appointment of super - visory board members can be revoked before the end of their respective term by a resolution of the annual general meeting that requires a majority of 75% of the votes cast and a majority of 75% of the share capital present at such meeting. Second, the articles of association may be amended by a resolution of the annual general meeting. Provided that such an amendment does not concern t he business purpose, this requires a simple majority of the votes cast and a simple majority of the share capital present at such meeting. Third, any provision regulating increased majority requirements can only be amended with the same increased majority. Dividend rights Each shareholder is entitled to receive dividends if and to the extent the distribution of dividends is resolved by the annual general meeting. Liquidation proceeds In case of dissolution of Erste Group Bank AG, the assets remaining after the discharge of liabilities and repayment of supplementary capital as well as additional tier 1 capital will be distributed pro-rata to the shareholders.

The dissolution of Erste Group Bank AG requires a majority of at least 75% of the share capital present at an annual general meeting. Subscription rights All holders of shares have subscription rights allowing them to subscribe to any newly issued shares to maintain their existing share in the share capital of Erste Group Bank AG. Such sub- scription rights are in proportion to the number of shares held by su ch shareholders prior to the issue of the new shares. The mentioned subscription rights do not apply if the respective shareholder does not exercise these subscription rights or the subscription rights are excluded in certain cases by a resolution of the a nnual general meeting or by a resolution of the manage- ment board and the supervisory board. The Austrian Stock Corporation Act contains provisions that protect the rights of individual shareholders. In particular, all shareholders must be treated equally under equal circum- stances unless the shareholders affected have consented to un- equal treatmen t. Furthermore, measures affecting shareholders’ rights, such as capital increases and the exclusion of subscrip- tion rights, generally require a shareholders’ resolution. The articles of association of Erste Group Bank AG do not con- tain any provisions regarding a change in the share capital, the rights associated with the shares or the exercise of the share- holders’ rights that differ from the statutory requirements. Stock corporations such as Erste Group Bank AG must hold at least one annual general meeting (ordinary shareholders’ meet- ing) per year, which must be held within the first eight months of any financial year and cover at least the following items: _ Presentation of certain documents _ Appropriation of profit _ Discharge of the members of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial year ended . At the annual general meetings, shareholders may ask for information about the company’s affairs to the extent that this is required for the proper assessment of an agenda item."

    "text": "1 Business performance and economic situation Economic environment From an economic point of view 2024 was mainly characterised by declining inflation, central bank responses, major elections across the globe, and regional conflicts. Inflation levels returned by and large to central bank targets, even though price pressur es persisted in some countries. The global economy remained resilient throughout this disinflationary process. On the monetary policy side, after the tightening cycle implemented in 2021 and 2022, most of the world’s major central banks started to graduall y reduce their restric- tive policy stance and to cut their policy rates in 2024. The presidential election in the United States, the European Parlia mentary elections as well as those in the United Kingdom and France also characterised the year. Against this backdrop the global economy achieved a growth rate of 3.2% . Among advanced economies, the United States again outperformed the euro area and Japan. Despite its elevated trade tensions w ith China, the US economy grew by 2.8% driven by private consumption, investments and government spending. In response to easing inflation, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) decreased the federal funds rate in three steps from 5.50% to 4.50%. The US governmen t deficit remained high in 2024. In Europe, strong demand for services was supportive, important tourism destinations such as Italy, Spain or Croatia performed well. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, on the other hand remained relatively weak. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut the key policy rate from 4.00% to 3.00% in four steps during the year. Both the asset purchase programme (AP P) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolios declined. The Governing Council decided to discontinue reinvest- ments under the PEPP at the end of 2024. Austria’s economic performance was weaker than originally expected and the country’s economy underperformed the European Union average. After the recessionary environment in 2023 Austria’s economy continued to decline. Despite increasing real wages private consumption remained subdued. High interest rates and energy costs continued to weigh on investments, especially in the construction and industry sectors. The industrial performance impacted Austria’s exports which are geared towards producing i nter- mediat e goods and machinery. The deteriorating performance of Germany, Austria’s main trading partner, negatively impacted Aus- tria’s exports. Exports to the US and Switzerland, on the other hand, grew strongly. The service sector did not show adverse effects due to the recessionary environment. Tourism boomed with summer season’s overnight stays reaching one of the highest levels for decades. The agricultural sector, although not a major contributor to GDP, also performed well. Overall, the Austrian economy shran k by 0.7% . Inflation decreased further during the year with average inflation in Austria amounting to 2.9% , still above the EU average of 2.4% . Service prices, especially in the hotel and restaurant industries, remained the main inflation driver. Energy prices, on the other hand, declined sharply, although from high levels.

The increase of the savings rate was partially due to a weaker consumer c onfidence. Austria’s labour market remained stable throughout the year, the unemployment rate stood at 5.3% . The general gov ernment deficit increased from 78.6% of GDP to 79.7% . Central and Eastern European economies experienced slightly accelerated economic growth primarily driven by household con- sumption on robust labour markets, easing inflation and, in most cases, higher real wages. Investment activity was fuelled by Next Gene ration European Union funds. Exports, on the other hand, were negatively impacted by limited growth of the region’s main trading partners which took a toll on production output. Deterioration of foreign demand was most pronounced in countries wit h a high d ependency on Germany’s economy, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary. Therefore, growth expectations were moderately revised down during the year in these two countries. Romania’s economy underperformed as well. The economies in Croatia and Serbia posted the highest growth dynamics. Croatia benefitted from its booming tourism sector and was again one of the best per- forming economies in the region. Overall, CEE economies achieved GDP growth rates ranging from 0.5% in Hungary to 3.9% in Serbia in 2024. Labour markets remained very strong in Central and Eastern Europe with the Czech Republic again posting one of the lowest unem- ployment rates among the European Union countries. Inflation dropped significantly, to low single -digits in most CEE countries by the end of the year. This was mainly due to the drop of energy and food prices. Most of the central banks in CEE continued wi th monetary easing. The Hungarian, Czech, and Polish central banks cut interest rates already in the last quarter of 2023, while the Serbian and Romanian central banks waited until the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively.

This was mainly due to higher loan volumes and higher interest income from debt securities. These effects were partly compensated by lower interest income from cash balances at central banks and higher in terest expenses on debt securities in issue. The net interest margin (calcu- lated as the annualised sum of net interest income, dividend income and net result from equity method investments over average interest -bearing assets) remained nearly stable at 2.46% (2.50%). Net fee and commission income Growth was achieved across all core markets and nearly all income categories. Significant rises were recorded in payment serv ices, driven by a larger number of transactions and repricing, as well as in asset management.

This includes most notably negative results from the sale of securities in the Czech Republic and in Austria. Impairment result from financial instruments The impairment result from financial instruments amounted to EUR - 397 Mio (EUR - 128 million). Net allocations to provisions for loans and advances increased – most notably in Austria – to EUR 394 million (EUR 264 million). Positive contributions came from income from the recovery of loans already written off, primarily in Austria, in the amount of EUR 72 million (EUR 80 million). Allocations to provisions for loan commitments and financial guarantees amounted to EUR 54 million (net releases of EUR 70 mi l- lion). Other operating result Other operating result is significantly affected by contributions to resolution funds and taxes and levies on banking activities. Con- tributions to resolution funds declined in all markets to EUR 28 million (EUR 113 million). The sharp decline is mainly due to the discontinuation of annual regular contributions from credit institutions in the euro zone in 2024. Taxes and levies on bankin g activ- ities included in this line item rose to EUR 245 million (EUR 183 million). Thereof, EUR 40 million (EUR 46 million) were payable by Austrian entities. In Hungary, banking levies rose to a total of EUR 168 million (EUR 137 million): in addition to the reg ular Hungarian banking tax of EUR 22 million (EUR 17 million), a windfall tax based on the previous year’s net revenu es was posted in the amount of EUR 52 million (EUR 48 million). The financial transaction tax amounted to EUR 9 1 million (EUR 71 million). In Romania, the newly introduced banking tax amounted to EUR 37 million. The Austrian entities posted allocations of EUR 102 million to a provision relating to the interbank exemption pursuant to Art 6 sec 1 subsec 28 (2nd sentence) Austrian VAT Act. This ex emption might be classified by the European Court of Justice or the EU Commission as incompatible with EU law and m ay have to be refunded.

    "text": "5 Retail business Erste Group’s key business is the retail business, covering the entire spectrum from lending, deposit and investment products to current accounts and credit cards. Erste Group’s core competence in retail banking has historical roots. In 1819, wealthy Vie nnese citizens donated funds to establish Erste Group’s predecessor, the first savings bank in Central Europe. It was their aim to bring basic banking services such as safe savings accounts and mortgage loans to wide sections of the population. Today, the ba nk serves over 16.5 million customers in its markets and operates nearly 1,900 branches. Wealthy private clients, trusts and foundations are served by the bank’s private banking staff and benefit from services that are tailored to the needs of this target group. In addition, the bank uses and promotes digital distribution channels such as internet and mobile banking not only to meet th e increasing importance of digital banking, but also to actively shape the digital future. George, Erste Group’s digital platfo rm, is already available in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Hungary. Following its introduction in Serbia end 20 25, George will be available in all seven core markets. Retail banking is attractive to Erste Group for a number of reasons: It offers a compelling business case that is built on ma rket lead- ership, an attractive risk -reward profile and the principle of self -funding. In addition, it benefits from a comprehensive range of products that are simple and easy to understand and provide substantial cross -selling potential. Erste Group takes advantage of these factors in all core markets and makes best use of its resulting position of strength by pursuing a hybrid busine ss model. Erste Group’s integrated -channel approach integrates the various sales and communication channels. Customers decide on how, when and where they do their banking business. Contact centers serve as interfaces between digital banking and traditional branch business. These contact centers offer advice and sales, thus going far beyond the traditional help desk function. In addition to the expansion of digital sales channels, the branch network remains an important component of the business str ategy. Only a retail bank that offers modern digital services and operates an extensive distribution network is able to offer tailo r-made solutions and fund loans in local currency mainly from deposits made in the same currency. In short, Erste Group’s retail ban king model supports sustainable and deposit -funded growth even in economically more challenging times. Another positive fact or is the diversification of the retail business across countries that are at differing stages of economic development, which is the ca se across the seven banking markets in which Erste Group has a direct presence. Corporate business The second main business line, which contributes significantly to Erste Group’s earnings, is business with small and medium - sized enterprises, regional and multi -national groups, commercial real estate and public sector companies.

Another positive fact or is the diversification of the retail business across countries that are at differing stages of economic development, which is the ca se across the seven banking markets in which Erste Group has a direct presence. Corporate business The second main business line, which contributes significantly to Erste Group’s earnings, is business with small and medium - sized enterprises, regional and multi -national groups, commercial real estate and public sector companies. Erste Group’s corporate strategy is based on a universal service approach, following an organic growth strategy aimed at increasing the number of primary clients and share of wallet across all corporate sub -segments. Erste Group strives to be the go -to bank for outstanding service including financial health and sustainable business conduct. Based on the specific client needs, Erste Group serves small and medium -sized enterprises locally in branches or dedicated commerc ial centers, while large, multinational groups are serviced by the Group Corporates, commercial real estate or public sector unit s. In addition, the digital channel is gaining more and more importance for Erste Group’s clients in the corporate segment. The outlined approach permits Erste Group to combine industry specific and product expertise with an understanding of regional needs and t he experience of the bank’s local customer relationship managers. Capital markets business Client -driven capital markets activities are also part of the comprehensive portfolio of products and services that Erste Group offers to its retail and corporate customers. The strategic significance of the bank’s centrally governed and locally rooted capital markets operations consists in supporting all other business areas in their dealings with the capital markets and, hence, in providin g the bank’s customers with professional access to the financial markets. Erste Group, therefore, views its capital ma rkets business as a link between financial markets and its customers. As a key capital markets player in the region, Erste Group also performs im portant functions such as market making, capital market research and product structuring. The capital markets business serves the needs of Erste Group’s retail and corporate customers, as well as those of banks and non - bank financial institutions. On account of Erste Group’s strong network in the eastern part of the European Union, the bank h as a thorough understanding of local markets and customer needs. In Erste Group’s capital markets business, too, the bank concentr ates on core markets of the Retail, SME, Large corporate, Corporate Real Estate and Public Sector business.

That means Erste Group’s banking subsidiaries are pioneers in some of these markets. Therefore, building more efficient capital markets in the region is another strategic objective of Erste Group’s capital markets activities."

    "text": "6 Customer Experience Index As a profit -driven enterprise, Erste Group has a strong interest in its customers’ future behaviour and loyalty to the bank. The CXI is an index that measures such loyalty and is derived from the evaluation of satisfaction ratings, referrals, readiness to switch to another bank, customer effort score and the repurchase rate of the main customers of the individual banks It thus reflects all conscious and unconscious experiences and decisions that our customers make with our bank in the courses of their lives and that have an impact on our customers’ relations with Erste Group. MEASURING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION The Customer Experience Index (CXI) is determined by Group Customer Experience, which is part of Group Brand Management & Communications, which in turn reports to the CEO. In the retail segment, a representative survey called the Banking Market Mo nitor is carried out on a quarterly basis. 2,400 telephone interviews (with customers and non -customers) are conducted annually across Erste Group’s markets. In the corporate customer segment, an extensive survey with at least 1,500 companies per country is ca rried out once a year. These analyses are conducted by an external market research institute and provide data for a performance com parison both within Erste Group and with its most important competitors. Based on these surveys, our customer relations are rated in five categories (advocate, loyal, simply satisfied, non -engaged and dissatisfied) and successful improvement of customer service is meas- ured using the CXI (Customer Experience Index). Based on these categories we calculate the CXI as follows: % advocates + % loyal customers + 0.5 x % simply satisfied - % non- engaged - % dissatisfied. The CXI rating therefore ranges on a scale from -100 to +100. This value is put in relation to the Top 3 competitors in each country and in each segment and is used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the local banks as compared to the market leaders. The CXI is of great relevance for Erste Group as it is also used as input in the bonus assessment for members of the management board of Erste Group, local banks and all employees. Targets for bonus evaluation purposes are set jointly by Group People & Culture, Group Customer Experience and relevant business lines.

CXI Privates (PI) In the segment of private customers Erste Bank Oesterreich and Erste Bank Croatia attained the best scores in their respectiv e mar- kets. All banks in all markets are stable (compared to the competition), with Erste Bank Oesterreich even improving in compar ison to the Top 3 competitors. CXI Micro Segment In the Micro Segment, the subsidiary banks Erste Bank Hungary, Erste Bank Serbia and Erste Bank Croatia managed to improve on the Top 3 competitors. Erste Bank Croatia also managed to take the lead in the banking market here. With the exception of Ceska Sporitelna, the performance of all other banks is stable. CXI SME Segment In the SME segment, BCR, Erste Bank Croatia and Slovenska Sporitelna achieved the first place in their markets. The development in this segment is stable in relation to the Top 3 competitors in most markets - the exceptions are Ceska Sporitelna, which is decreasing, and Erste Bank Serbia and BCR, which are developing positively. Erste Group’ s Strategy Erste Group has devised a comprehensive and forward -looking strategy to secure its position as a leading financial institution in the eastern part of the EU while addressing the challenges of rapidly changing market dynamics. Erste Group’s strategy addresses sig-nificant global developments, including economic shifts, demographic changes, technological advancements, geopolitical fragmen- tation, and climate change, to ensure sustainable growth and resilience even in the event of a different future. The political landscape in Europe and globally is changing rapidly, with rising populism, sentiments and measures hostile to the European idea, and potential political interventions in such forms as tariffs and new or expanded taxes posing challenges to some or all of the bank’s core markets and to Europe more broadly. These challenges increase pressure on the continent’s politicians, often leading to more interventionist policies and a distancing from the norms and practices that have so far shaped the EU. Monito ring and appropriately responding to these developments on both global an d CEE -specific levels is crucial for a large publicly -listed firm with a prominent presence across the region. Technological advancements, including AI, virtual/augmented reality, tokenized finance, and quantum technology, are evolving quickly. For Erste Group, data science and AI are expected to impact business operations and customer interactions, further enablin g high -quality and highly individualized digital advice and driving the demand for such advice on the part of the bank’s clients. The continuing convergence potential of CEE countries with the EU -27 remains a core principle of the bank’s business model. How- ever, rising wages and the end of cheap energy in Europe present growth challenges for the CEE economies, necessitating adapt ations to their long -term growth strategy.

Against the backdrop of ageing populations, Erste Group’s mission to provide access to finan cial health across all age groups and customer segments takes on even more importance. Environmental risks are also becoming increasingly significant. Projections indicate that five of the top ten global risks in the next decade are likely to be environmental, such as extreme weather events and biodiversity loss. Erste Group is dedicated to sustainability and aims to support social inclusion and is actively taking steps to support the net -zero transition being pursued by its customers and region. Erste Group’s strategy centers on five overarching objectives, designed to drive sustainable growth, improve customer experience and strengthen operational excellence. These objectives emphasize the need for transformation, innovation, and efficiency while inte- grating principles of sustainability to ensure the bank remains competitive and relevant in a rapidly changing financial land scape. Building a d istinctive brand identity At the heart of Erste Group's strategic goals is the creation of a unique and highly recognizable brand identity that resonat es across its markets. Erste Group seeks to differentiate itself from competition in the financial sector that is increasingly beco ming commod- itized. This involves positioning Erste Group as more than just a bank, focusing instead on being a trusted partner that unde rstands and meets the needs of its customers at every stage of their financial journey."

This customer -first ap proach is not only designed to foster customer -loyalty, but also to build long -term relationships by providing value that extends beyond conventional banking. The group's strong branding initiatives also seek to reinforce its reputation as a forward -thinki ng and cus- tomer -focused financial institution. Providing everyone with access to financial expertise and financial advice Erste Group proactively empowers every customer to improve their financial health. Modern technologies, particularly artifici al in- telligence (AI), are at the core of Erste Group’s strategic objective to provide everyone with access to financial advice. The bank aims to make high- quality financial expertise accessible to a much broader customer base by applying AI and data -driven solutions. This represents a significant shift from traditional models, where personalized financial advice was often limited only to higher -income clients. Erste Group’s use of technology enables customized insights and recommendations tailored to individual financial needs. Wheth er customers are seeking advice on investments, savings or retirement planning, this approach ensures they receive relevant info rmation and product offers in an easy -to-understand format to improve their financial health. Importantly, these technological advancements will complement but not replace human interaction, ensuring that customers can still benefit from face -to-face or conve rsation -based support when needed. Through these efforts, Erste Group aims to bridge the gap between technology and personal service, creating a seamless, hybri d advisory model that enhances the customer experience. Erste Group is also committed to integrating sustainability and ESG pri nci- ples and to improving financial literacy across its markets as a means of fostering informed decision -making on the part of its clients. Driving efficiency through digitization A critical element of Erste Group's transformation is its commitment to comprehensive digitization. The bank plans to digitiz e all key processes across its operations, from customer -facing interactions to internal workflows, creating a more efficient and a gile or- ganization. This focus on end -to-end digital solutions will not only enhance the speed and convenience of banking for customers but also deliver significant cost savings and reduce operational risk through lowering the share of manual processes and improving op-erational efficiency. Digitization efforts range from streamlining customer journeys, enabling seamless interactions through platforms such as Erste Group’s flagship digital banking platform George, to digitizing internal functions. This ensures that customers can manage their banking needs independently while receiving a premium, user -friendly digital experience. By making banking faster, more intuitive, and more accessible, Erste Group can free up resources, allowing employees to dedicate more time to high- value activities.

By aligning its product portfolio with the priorities of its customers, Erste Group ensures that it remains relevant in an increasingly compet itive market. Erste Group facilitates the green transition of its corporate customers and, in order to align the retail business with the sustainability strategy, Erste Group offers products and services that promote decarbonization and improve both financial health and environmen- tal sustainability.

By delivering value -driven and innovative solutions, Erste Group is positioning itself as a partner that genuinely cares about the prosperity of its clients. Expanding through organic and i norganic growth Recognizing the growth potential within the CEE region’s banking sector, Erste Group is actively pursuing opportunities for both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. By strengthening its presence in existing markets or potentially entering new o nes, the bank aims to consolidate its position as a leading player in the region. Pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions will allow the group to scale its operations, tap into new customer bases and achieve greater synergies across its network.

Erste Group's sustainability strategy is based on two main pillars: leading the green transition and promoting social inclusion. The Group supports the green transition in the CEE region by promoting a sustainable real estate sector and reducing emission s in the energy sector, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and net zero targets. Erste Group offers sustainable financing, s ustainable investment funds and advisory services to help businesses and private clients reduce their environmental footprint and positi ons itself as a preferred partner for sustainability -oriented clients. In addition to sustainable mortgage loans, new renovation products for improving the energy efficiency of buildings have been created in the private customer business. Corporate customers are sup- ported in taking advantage of the benefits of decarbonization through a range of advisory services and financin g to support cost - efficient measures. These include renewable energy projects and highly efficient buildings in the commercial real estate sect or. In- ternally, Erste Group is reducing its carbon footprint by increasing the energy efficiency of its buildings and switching to alternative energy sources where possible. Social responsibility is embedded in Erste Group’s DNA, with initiatives aimed at reducing inequality, increasing financial a ccess, and supporting community development. The bank also focuses on governance, ensuring transparency, ethical decision -making, a nd accountability. Innovation is key in this sphere too, with advanced technologies like AI and data analytics enhancing sustainability solution s. Erste Group’s holistic approach to sustainability aligns its business goals with ESG principles, ensuring inclusive, responsible growth. This strategy combines customer -centric initiatives, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and sustainable growth, positioning Erste Group as a trusted financial institution in the CEE region . Outlook statement SUMMARY 2025 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK STATEMENT Erste Group’s goal for 2025 is to achieve a return on tangible equity (ROTE) of about 15%. This ambition is built on the following key assumptions: (1) The macroeconomic environment, primarily as measured by real GDP growth, in Erste Group’s seven core markets (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia) remains robust and on average, improves moderately versus 202 4. Consequent ly, Erste Group expects robust loan growth of about 5% in 2025, supported by growth in the retail as well as the corporate business. (2) Operating performance as defined by operating result to stay broadly stable versus 2024, as net interest income is pro- jected to remain flat year -on-year, fee and commission income continues to grow by about 5%, net trading and fair result produces a similar revenue contribution as in 2024, and operating expenses grow on the order of 5%. Consequently, the cost/income r atio is expected to be below 50%. (3) Risk costs increase only slightly to about 25 basis points of average customer loans from level s seen in 2024, as the asset quality environment"

Consequently, the cost/income r atio is expected to be below 50%. (3) Risk costs increase only slightly to about 25 basis points of average customer loans from level s seen in 2024, as the asset quality environment remains strong across Central and Eastern Europe while only deteriorating moderately in Austria. (4) Regulatory costs, comprising deposit insurance and resolution fund contributions, banking levies such as banking and financial transaction taxes as well as sector -specific extra profit taxes, and, the cost of supervision, in aggr egate, are expected to in- crease due to an announced increased banking tax in Austria. While a forecast for the other operating result, which is primarily impacted by regulatory costs excluding deposit insurance contri-butions as well as extra profit tax in Slovakia, and various categories of gains and losses from financial instruments not me asured at fair value is challenging, this combined item is likely to stay flat versus 2024 in the absence of significant one -off effects. Assuming an effective group tax rate of about 21% and lower minority charges compared to 2024, all of the above should result in return on tangible equity of about 15% in 2025. In line with the projected strong profit performance, the CET1 ratio is expected to increase in 2025, providing enhanced capi tal return and/or M&A flexibility. The adjusted net profit of 2024 (net profit after deduction of AT1- dividends) allows Erste Group to target a regular dividend equalling 41.2% of adjusted net profit as well as the execution of a third share buyback in the amount of 23 .7% of adjusted net profit, subject to regulatory approval. Potential risks to the guidance include (geo)political and economic (including monetary and fiscal policy impacts) developments, regulatory measures as well as changes to the competitive environment. International (military) conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East do not impact Erste Group directly, as it has no operating presence in the regions involved. Indirect effects, such as financial markets volatility, sanctions -related knock -on effects, supply chain disruptions or the emergence of deposit insur- ance or resolution cases cannot be ruled out, though. Erste Group is moreover exposed to non -financial and legal risks that may materialise regardless of the economic environment. Worse than expected economic development may put goodwill a t risk."

    "text": "10 DETAILED 2025 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK STATEMENT: DISCUSSION OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS (1) Assumptions on 2025 macroeconomic environment (2) Assumptions on 2025 operating performance (3) Assumptions on 2025 risk/asset quality environment (4) Assumptions on 2025 regulatory costs Ad 1) Erste Group evaluates the macroeconomic environment, amongst others, along the following key parameters: real GDP growth, consumer price inflation, unemployment rate, current account balance, general government balance and public debt. Its economi sts forec ast that real GDP growth will improve in all of Erste Group’s core markets, except for Croatia and Serbia, where it will cons olidate close to the healthy levels registered in 2024. Overall, 2025 GDP growth is expected in the range of 0.6% (Austria) to 3.8% (Serbia), mainly supported by a recovery in private consumption. Consumer price inflation is projected to moderate or consolidate in mo st core markets in the low to mid -single -digit range, as the moderate acceleration of economic growth is not expected to lead to addi- tional inflationary pressure. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at similarly low levels, as recorded in 2024, drive n by the generally supportive economic backdrop and the continued strong competitiveness of the CEE region. In line wi th historic patterns, the continuation of diverging trends is expected for external and internal (fiscal) balances. The former is forecast to stay at sustainable levels in most core markets, while remaining significantly negative in Romania and Serbia. The latter is projected to improve in all countries in 2025, but remain elevated in Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. This notwithstanding public debt to GDP is forecast to remain broadly unchanged at sustainable levels in all core markets of Erste Group, especi ally when viewed in a broader European context. This macroeconomic scenario is based on information available at 15 February 2025. Consequently, any changes to the global and, in particular, European political, economic and regulatory landscape, thereafter , may lead to significant deviations in actual economic performance from the scenario presented. Ad 2) Operating performance, essentially the operating result, is expected to remain broadly stable year -on-year, while the cost/in- come ratio is forecast to stay below 50%. Operating income is forecast to be unchanged, supported by stable year -on-year net interest income and net trading and fair value result. Net fee and commission income is expected to grow by about 5%. Stable net inter est income should result from negative effects being balanced by positives. The primary net interest income headwind is pr ojected to be central bank rate cuts to 3.25%, 5.75%, 6.00%, 5.00% and 2.00% by year -end 2025 in Czechia, Romania, Hungary, Serbia and the euro zone, respectively. Lower interest rates, in turn, will mainly be driven by moderate economic growth and limited inflation pressures. On the positive side, Erste Group expects loan growth of about 5% in 2025, higher income from the bond book, continued upward fixed loan repricing in certain geographies, such as Czechia and Slovakia, and swift downward repricing of d eposits in all markets."

On the positive side, Erste Group expects loan growth of about 5% in 2025, higher income from the bond book, continued upward fixed loan repricing in certain geographies, such as Czechia and Slovakia, and swift downward repricing of d eposits in all markets. The most volatile revenue line item is net trading and fair value result, as it is fundamentally driven by the development of market interest rates and valuations related to such market interest rates. Based on current expectations Erste Group forecasts this line item to be broadly unchanged year -on-year. Net fee and commission income is projected to grow by about 5% as income from payment services, securities business (including asset management) and insurance brokerage are all expected to grow, assuming the above - mentioned constructive macroeconomic backdrop and a stable to positive capital markets environment. The remaining income com-ponents are forecast to remain, by and large, stable. Overall, operating income is therefore expect ed to be flat in 2025. Operating expenses are expected to increase by about 5% in 2025. While wage inflation is forecast to recede, particularly in Austria, o ther ad- ministrative expenses are projected to rise on the back of higher costs associated with business digitisation targeting improved digital advice, further expansion of the digital customer offering and digital process optimisation. Ad 3) Risk costs are expected to amount to about 25 basis points as of average gross customer loans in 2025. This assumes tha t the risk and asset quality environment will continue to stay benign across Central and Eastern Europe, while only deteriorating m ildly in Austria. The deterioration in Austria is tied to the protracted economic weakness in both 2023 and 2024 and the projection of only moderate improvement in 2025. Furthermore, the risk guidance assumes that an additional EUR 190 million in overlay a nd forward - looking indicator (FLI) provisions will be released during 2025. Ad 4) The total regulatory cost burden, over and above general taxation, in 2024 amounted to about EUR 450 million. This incl uded deposit insurance and resolution fund contributions, banking levies such as banking and financial transaction taxes as well a s sector - specific profit taxes, and the cost of supervision. For 2025 Erste Group expects this cost to rise to approximately EUR 550 m illion, primarily due to an announced increase of the banking tax"

Digital technologies reshape not only consumer expectations. Erste Group is convinced that digital banking will furt her gain in importance and will be essential for sustainable economic success in the long term and is therefore committed to digi tal innovation. Intra -group interdisciplinary teams are developing innovative solutions with the goal of offering everyone access to fi- nancial literacy and financial advice and helping the bank’s customers to strengthen their financial health in a sustainable manner. The centre -piece of Erste Group’s digital strategy is the digital platform George, designed to provide customers access to personalised products of Erste Group. APIs support a wide range of co -operation arrangements with fintechs, start -ups and even across industries and can therefore help to open up new markets and attract new customers. George is available to retail customers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Hungary. It will be rolled out in Serbia in 2026. At present, George is being actively used by more than ten million customers. The portfolio of digitally available products and services is being constantly expan ded. Customers can activate applications via plug -ins and use them to manage their finances. George Business was developed to provide excellent digital banking to corporate customers as well. It was implemented in Aust ria in 2022 and in Romania in 2023. In the Czech Republic, roll -out will be completed in 2025. It is the aim to offer all customer segments across the group an outstanding digital user experience on a single platform. Digital innovation such as artificial intelligence and deep customer data analysis are the key to success. Erste Group’s holi stic ap- proach combines the broadening of financial expertise through the use of modern technologies ( ‘digital advisory ’) with the digitali- sation of all relevant bank processes. In 2024, software development costs of EUR 25 million (EUR 33 million) were capitalised. Reporting on material characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the accounting process Internal Control System Framework Requirements The internal control system (ICS) is an essential element of the corporate governance system of Erste Group contributing to the safeguarding of shareholders’ investments and company’s assets. Erste Group’s ICS plays a key role in identifying risks assoc iated with the respective internal processes. The ICS policy provides the framework conditions for the internal control system at Erste Group. It defines current standards con- cerning general tasks and responsibilities as well as minimum criteria for ICS documentation. In Erste Group, a top down, ris k ori- ented, decentralised ICS approach is applied, designed based on the local process map, which promotes adequacy by focusing on all material risks. This means, that all material risks identified must be mitigated by key controls which are involved in the ICS process. The following criteria are applied for an adequate ICS: —"

All material risks must be covered with key controls, to demonstrate the importance at local level. — Effectiveness and traceability: The functionality of key controls are regularly checked, the optimal control environment is r e- viewed and challenged during monitoring activity of risk appetite/tolerance. — Comprehensibility: The process landscape together with local policies and procedures constitute documentation of identified k ey controls, which ensures that relevant employees are aware of all key controls and their role in the internal control process is transparent and accountable within the entire local entity.

    "text": "12 illustrated in the framework of the consolidated risk reporting (GRR) for the management or relevant risk committee. Control environment The Code of Conduct provides orientation for all employees of Erste Group, defines mandatory rules for day -to-day business life, describes the corporate values, affirms the obligation to act responsibly as a company and ensures compliance with legal prov isions and internal guidelines (compliance). The awareness of potential compliance issues and a sustainable risk culture enable risks to be identified quickly and well -considered decision -making when dealing with existing regulations. The main component of the risk culture are internal guidelines and , above all, open communication in order to create the broadest possible awareness of all employees for all risks that Erste Group is con- fronted with. The management board is responsible for the establishment, structure and application of an appropriate internal control and r isk management system that meets the company’s needs in its group accounting procedures. Erste Group’s IFRS Accounting Manual provides a comprehensive methodological basis for the preparation and submission of the monthly, quarterly and annual IFRS Group Reporting Packages by Erste Group’s subsidiaries. The management in each subsidiary is responsible for implementing group -wide instructions. Compliance with group rules is mon- itored as part of the audits performed by group and local auditors. Group Accounting and Group Controlling are responsible for preparing the consolidated financial reporting. Both divisions are as- signed to the CFO of Erste Group. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of the Group Ac- counting department. The assignment of competencies, the process description and the necessary control procedures are defined in the working instructions. Risk assessment and controls measures The main risk in the financial reporting procedures is that errors or deliberate action (fraud) prevent facts from adequately reflecting the company’s financial position and performance. This is the case if the data provided in the financial statements and notes is materially deviating from the correct figures, i.e. whenever, alone or in aggregate, they could influence the decisions made by the users of financial statements. Such a decision may incur serious damage, such as financial loss, the imposition of sanctions by the banking supervisor or reputational harm. Furthermore, especially estimates for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments for which no reliable mark et value is available, estimates for the accounting of risk provisions for loans and advances and for provisions, complex measureme nt require- ments for accounting as well as a volatile business environment bear the risk of significant financial reporting errors. Erste Group issues group policies used for preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. A summar y description of the accounting process is provided in Erste Group’s IFRS Accounting Manual. All transactions in subsidiaries have to be recorded, posted and accounted for in accordance with the accounting and measurement methods set out in this manual.

The subsequent consolidation steps are then performed using the consolidation system. These include consolidation of capital, expense and income consolidation, and debt consolidation, any intragroup gains are eliminat ed. At the end of the consolidation process, the notes to the consolidated financial statements are prepared in acco rdance with IFRS and BWG/UGB. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report are reviewed by the audit committee of the supervisory board and are also presented to the supervisory board for approval. They are published as part of the annual report, on Erste Group ’s website and in the Official Journal of Wiener Zeitung and finally filed with the Commercial Register. Information and communication Throughout the year, the group produces consolidated monthly reports for group management. Statutory interim reports are pro-duced that conform to the provisions of IAS 34 and are also published quarterly in accordance with the Austrian Stock Corpora tion Act. Before publication, the consolidated financial information is presented to senior managers and the CFO for final approval and then submitted to the supervisory board’s audit committee. Reporting is almost fully automated, based on source systems and automated interfaces, and guarantees up -to-date data for control- ling, segment reporting and other analyses. Accounting information is derived from the same data source and is reconciled mon thly for reporting purposes. Close collaboration between accounting and controlling permits continual target/actual comparisons fo r con- trol and reconciliation purposes. Monthly and quarterly reports to the management board and the supervisory board ensure a regular flow of financial information and monitoring of the internal control system. In addition, when introducing new core banking systems and implementing new products, accounting is in contact with the relev ant departments in order to provide information at an early stage on accounting -specific aspects and implications for new product launches. Monitoring In order to monitor and at the same time support strong governance and risk management, Erste Group applies three lines of defence to review the structures and processes that enable the achievement of the objectives for their effectiveness. The first line of defence includes the business lines in which the department heads are responsible for monitoring including internal controls of their business areas. This line is in constant dialogue with the business areas and reports on planned, actual and expected results in connection with the goals of the organisation as well as on risks. The role of the second line of defence is covered by specific areas of expertise, in addition to providing expertise, support , monitoring and risk management tasks.

The third line of defence is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance and advice on the adequacy and effective- ness of governance and risk management. Internal Audit is in charge of auditing and evaluating all areas of the bank based on risk- oriented audit areas (according to the annual aud it plan as approved by the management board and reported to the audit committee). The main focus of audit reviews is to monitor the completeness and functionality of the internal control system. Internal Aud it has the duty of reporting its findings to the group’s management board, supervisory board and audit committee several times within one year. Internal Audit is according to section 42 Austrian Banking Act (BWG) a control body that is directly subordinate to the manag ement board. Its sole purpose is to comprehensively verify the lawfulness, propriety and expediency of the banking business and ban king operation on an on -going basis.

DIRECTORS & OFFICERS -INSURANCE In the event that any of the following transactions or processes occur during the term of the insurance policy (each constituting a ‘change in control’) in respect of the insured: — the insured ceases to exist as a result of a merger or consolidation, unless the merger or consolidation occurs between two i nsured parties, or — another company, person or group of companies or persons acting in consent, who are not insured parties, acquire more than 50 % of the insured’s outstanding equity or more than 50% of its voting power (resulting in the right to control the voting power repre- sented by the shares, and the right to appoint the Management Board members of the insured), then the insurance cover under this policy remains in full force and effect for claims relating to unlawful acts committed or alleged to have been committed before this change in control took effect. However, no insurance cover is provided for claims relat ing to unlawful acts committed or allegedly committed after that time (unless the insured and insurer agree otherwise). The premium for this insurance cover is deemed to be completely earned. In the event that a subsidiary ceases to be a subsidiary during the insurance period, the insurance cover under this policy s hall remain in full force and effect for that entity for the remainder of the insurance period or (if applicable) until the end of the extended discov- ery period, but only in respect of claims brought against an insured in relation to unlawful acts committed or alleged to hav e been committed by the insured during the existence of this entity as a subsidiary.

Originally concluded in 2008 (between Erste Bank der österreichischen Sparkassen AG and Vienna Insurance Group der WIENER STÄDTISCHE Versicherung AG), the Agreement was renewed and extended in 2018 until the end of 2033. The objective for the renewal and extension in particular was to adapt the Agreement to the corporate restructuring of the original parties, to amend some commercial parameters and to align the Agreement with recent developments in the legal framew ork. Already in the o riginal Agreement the parties stipulated that both parties have the right to terminate the Agreement in case of a change of control of one of the parties. In case of change of control of Erste Group Bank AG, VIG has the right to terminate the Agreement. In case of change of control of VIG, Erste Group Bank AG has the reciprocal right. A change of control is defined, with respect to Erste Group Bank AG, as the acquisition of Erste Group Bank AG by any person/entity other than DIE ERSTE öster- reichische Spar -Casse Privatstiftung or Austrian savings banks of 50% plus one share of Erste Group Bank AG’s shares or voting rights. In respect to VIG, the aforementioned provisions apply analogously, except for share purchases by Wiener Städtische W ech- selseitiger Versic herungsverein – Vermögensverwaltung – Vienna Insurance Group. Apart from this regulation on the termination of the Agreement, the parties agreed in the renewal and extension of the Agreem ent for an additional termination for cause if based on new legal or regulatory provisions, the continuation of the Agreement is unrea-sonable for each or both of the parties. Erste Group Bank AG and VIG are furthermore parties to an asset management agreement, pursuant to which Erste Group under- takes to manage certain parts of VIG’s and its group companies’ securities assets. In case of a change of control (as describ ed above), each party has the termination right. The asset management agreement has been renewed and extended until 2033 concurrently wi th the renewal and extension of the Agreement outlined above. 9. Indemnification agreements In the event of a public takeover offer, there are no compensation agreements between Erste Group Bank AG and its executive b oard and supervisory board members or employees."

Under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), to be transposed into national law until 6 July, 2024, these r equire- ments are replaced by the requirement to include a s ustainability statement prepared in accordance with ESRS in the consolidated management report. As of date, the transposition of the CSRD into Austrian law is still pending. In previous years, Erste Group Bank AG utilized the option pursuant to § 267a (6) and § 243b (6) of the Austrian Commercial C ode (UGB) and prepared a separate, combined ( consolidated) non-financial report, in conformity with GRI Standards 2021. In order to anticipate the overdue changes in reporting requirements, Erste Group Bank AG chose to comply with its still existing legal n on- financial reporting obligation by preparing a s ustainability statement in accordance with ESRS for the financial year 2024 and pre- senting it as a separate section of its (consolidated) non -financial statement in this consolidated management report. Any additional information required by §§ 243b, 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) which is not covered by the s ustainability statement is presented in the chapter ‘Additional information pursuant to §§ 243b, 267a of the Austrian Commercoal Code (UGB)’ ; this specif- ically comprises continuing selected information and KPIs referring to Erste Group Bank AG on a non -consolidated basis as presented in previous years. Additional information pursuant to §§ 243b, 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) Matters not covered by the Sustainbility Statement As ESRS reporting follows the double materiality assessment, certain matters required to be reported in the non -financial statement are not covered by the s ustainability statement.

    "text": "22 Basis for preparation BP-1 – GENERAL BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT For 2024, Erste Group Bank AG has integrated its sustainability statement into the management report. This report has been prepared on a consolidated basis, using the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as a framework, alongside the requirements of Article 8 of EU Regulation 2020/852 (EU Taxonomy). Previously the option was used pursuant to § 267a (6) and § 243b (6) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) to prepare a separate non -financial report . The scope of consolidation of the sustainability statement follows the scope of consolidation of the financial statement, which is prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is shown in Note 69 of the 2024 consolidated financial statement . Information in this statement relates to the entities within this scope of consolidation , as well as the Group’s upstream and downstream value chain . Where this is not the case , this is indicated in the text. To ensure that all material sustainability matters are addressed, the group of Erste Group Bank AG (hereinafter referred to as ‘Erste Group’ or ‘Group’ ) conducted a value chain assessment, which was part of the double materiality assessment (DMA). This materiality assessment helped Erste Group to identify and assess impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) across the value chain. For furt her information on the value chain and its assessment, please refer to the disclosure in chapter ‘ SBM -1 – Strategy, busine ss model and value chain ’. Erste Group has not exercised the option to exclude information related to intellectual property, know -how, or innovation results, as there is no such information that requires disclosure. Salzburger Sparkasse Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Kärntner Sparkasse Aktiengesellschaft and Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Spar-kassen AG (Erste Bank Oesterreich) are subsidiaries of Erste Group Bank AG that are exempted from consolidated sustainability reporting pursuant to Articles 19a(9) or 29a(8) of Directive 2013/34/EU. BP-2 – DISCLOSURES IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, T IME HORIZONS AND DATA METHODOLOGY FOR REPORTING Estimation uncertainty and assumptions Certain disclosed metrics have been calculated using estimates and assumptions. Information on the estimates and data sources, including potential measurement uncertainties and assumptions, where applicable, is provided in the respective topical chapters. Erste Group discloses metrics that incorporate value chain information which has either been sourced directly from counterpar ties or derived indirectly through third -party data providers or industry -specific proxies. A high level of measurement uncertainty due to limitations in data and methodologies relate to the disclosure of GHG emission s. In Erste Group’s analysis and climate target -setting, estimates have been made using the recogni sed frameworks available at the time. Detailed descriptions of the methodological approaches can be found in sections E1 -4 and E1 -6.

Erste Group’s parameters are based on expectations, projections and estimations, which inherently involve a degree o f un- certainty and risk. This is due to factors such as evolving methodologies, fluctuating market conditions, technological advancements and challenges in data availability, accuracy, as well as potential regulatory changes. These assessments are subject to chan ge and should not be considered reliable indicators of future performance. General information"

The Group ESG Office supports this process with its expertise and may exercise its veto right within the Credit Committee to ensure the alignment of the portfolio and Erste Group’s banking practices with the objectives of the Group. All IROs that were categorised as material in the DMA were discussed with and approved by the Management Board and presented to the Audit Committee. For a list of all material IROs, please refer to the list in chapter ‘ SBM -3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model ’. Policy governance The CEO is responsible for central functions, including sustainability matters related to the Own Workforce. The CFO oversees fi- nance, while the COO handles IT and banking services. Risk management, including environmental risks, falls under the CRO’s responsibility. Although the group Management Board holds overall responsibility for a unified strategy and framework, each l ocal management board is tasked with implementing these policies, taking into account their specific circumstances .

T herefore, the calculation of its fi- nanced CO 2 emissions supports the group to comply with regulatory reporting requirements and the implementation of the overall sustainability strategy and is the responsibility of Enterprise wide & Operational Risk Management (ERM). ERM is in the CRO division of Erste Group Bank AG and provides a framework and guidance to all entities within the scope of Carbon Footprint Calculation Policy, which was approved by the Management Board in February 2024. The p olicy covers the pro- cesses and responsibilities in connection with financed emissions and includ es specifications of g roup vs. l ocal ownerships through- out the calculation process. The local boards are responsible for the implementation of the policy on a subsidiary level. Local ERM acts as focal point for topics related to the carbon footprint calculation of each bank subsidiary and has the ownership of developing and implementing the Local Carbon Footprint Calculation Policy to reflect the group p olicy. Regular communication between ERM and l ocal ERM via a working group shall ensure that a mutual understanding of carbon footprint calculation related topics across Erste Group exists. Policy governance for the Diversity IRO Fostering an inclusive corporate culture creates an open environment of acceptance and support for all people. Therefore, Group Diversity Management (GDM) supports the implementation of the overall strategy by developing a comprehensive communication strategy for Erste Group’s diversity impact and by acting as a source of expertise for Erste Group’s management as well as local Diversity Management (LDM). In addition, GDM provides partnership and guidance to diversity -related employee resource groups (e.g., Erste Women’s Hub, ErsteColours, ErsteABILITY). GDM is organi sed as a Group function within the CEO division of Erste Group Bank AG. GDM provides a framework and guidance to all entities within the scope of the Group Diversity & Inclusion Policy. Embedded in the Group People & Culture division, GDM collects group -wide diversity data, identifies key focus areas and develops a diversity strategy in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders (such as local Diversity Management, Group Communications & Corporate Affairs , Group ESG Office). GDM develops diversity targets and provides diversity data for reports, rating agencies and communication on a Group level. The Management Board engages in active dialogue with GDM on Erste Group’s diversity impact as well as to support and implement group -wide activities to promote diversity and inclusion. LDM acts as a focal point for the diversity impact of each bank subsidiary.

GOV -3 – INTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABILITY -RELATED PERFORMANCE IN INCENTIVE SCHEMES Erste Group is committed to a remuneration system that integrates sustainability matters. The Group Remuneration Policy for Erste Group Bank AG outlines the structure and criteria for compensating members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board . No variable remuneration is paid to members of the Supervisory Board . For the Management Board , variable remuneration is capped relative to fixed remuneration with a maximum of 100% or, by share- holder resolution, up to 200%. This variable remuneration is granted and paid based on specific, measurable performance criteria that align with Erste Group’s business strategy and long -term development. These criteria ar e annually assessed by the remuneration committee of the Supervisory Board of Erste Group Bank AG. Variable remuneration is structured to include both upfront and deferred payments. For amounts exceeding EUR 150,000, 60% of the variable remuneration is deferred, while for amounts below this threshold, 40% is deferred. At least half of both the upfront and deferred remuneration is delivered in the form of non- cash instruments, such as shares (Performance Share Units , PSUs), with the remaining portion paid in cash. The Group Remuneration Policy also includes malus and clawback provisions in accordance with EBA guidelines."

According to the Group Remuneration Policy , ESG targets proposed by the Group ESG Office and approved by the remuneration committee are integral to the scorecards of the Management Board and senior management. In 2024, 15% of each Management Board member’s variable remuneration was based on ESG criteria. The Supervisory Board, through its independent remuneration c ommit- tee, sets the remuneration of Management Board members. This committee prepares the Supervisory Board’s resolutions on remu- neration in accordance with legal requirements. Performance is assessed on a 5 -point rating scale, with ESG factors accounting for 15% of the overall performance evaluation, which Group ESG Office then evaluates at the end of the performance period. The results of this evaluation are reviewed and approv ed by the remuneration committee, who subsequently informs the Supervisory Board. Erste Group’s target volume of Sustainable Financing and retail mortgages are determined according to the criteria described in E1 - 4 and must not be confused with the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) KPI under the EU Taxonomy."

These risks are also valid for value chain data, as well as qualitative or quantitative information provided in the sus tainability statement that would materially deviate from the correct figures or circumstances, i.e. whenever, alone or in aggregate, they could inf luence the decisions made by the users of the sustainability statement. To mitigate the risks of misstatements, Erste Group uses a rigorous risk management system based on internal control processes (ICS). The sustainability reporting process is integrated in the financial reporting process as outlined in the chapter ‘ Reporting on material characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the accounting process ’ of the management report. Therefore, the basic components of the ICS for the financial reporting within Erste Group are also used for the quantitative infor- mation in sustainability reporting. These include: — systemic, automatic control systems and measures in the formal procedure and structure, e.g. programmed controls during data processing — principles of functional separation and checks performed by a second person (the four -eye principle) — highly automated data validation in the group consolidation process Internal controls for the processing of qualitative data include the 4 -eyes principle (which also applies to quantitative data). This process includes multiple internal feedback loops, management reviews and external consulting. Furthermore, evidence for i m- portant qualitative statements, such as minutes of meetings, contracts as well as board approvals is collected and documented to ensure the accuracy and relevance of qualitative data."

In addition, a datapoint analysis was conducted by to ensure th at all relevant material information related to material topics is adequately disclosed. Future considerations will include continuous improvement , whereby the results of the risk management process will be used to continuously improve the sustainability reporting process. This means refining internal controls, enhancing data validation p roce- dures and conducting regular assessments to ensure the rele vance and accuracy of reported information. Furthermore, feedback from internal reviews, external consultants and auditors will be incorporated into future reporting cycles to address any ide ntified gaps or areas for improvement.

Erste Group ’s business model centres around retail and corporate banking, encompassing a wide array of services from lending, deposits and investments to current accounts and credit cards. With a customer base exceeding 16 million across its markets and a network of approximately 1,300 branches, the bank caters to various costumer groups , providing tailored servic es to meet the specific needs of its clients. Erste Group’s position in its markets makes it one of the major providers of finance to local businesses, including large com panies, real estate companies and to the public sector. While Erste Group’s roots are in the retail small & medium sized enterprises (SME) business, Erste Group has taken account of its role and responsibility and has firmly embraced corporate and public sector le nding as part of its business model. For further information on the business segments of Erste Group refer to Note 1 in the consolidated financial statement. For further information on the headcount of employees by geographical area of Erste Group refer to chapter S1-6. Erste Group’s sustainability strategy Since Erste Group’s foundation it has been pursuing the goal defined in the Statement of Purpose, namely, to promote and secure prosperity for all people throughout the region. This is why it has incorporated key ESG themes into the business strategy. Erste Group believes that this is the only way to be successful over the long term, working towards a fairer and more inclusive soc iety. Erste Group’s sustainability strategy centres on two main pillars, leading the green transition and promoting social inclusion: Leading the green transition Erste Group’s primary impact on the environment lies in its lending activities and more precisely , the resulting financed emissions. As a financial institution , it is therefore its role to contribute to the transition towards a low -carbon economy by engaging with its clients and supporting them along their decarbonisation pathway while facing evolving challenges , such as policy uncertainty, both on country and European level. Erste Group believes this to be the most important lever to help fostering a green transition. Erste Group’s strategic priorities relating to the environment include achieving: — a net -zero status of Erste Group’s portfolio by 2050, — a net -zero status in banking operations by 2030 and — strengthened leadership in sustainable financing by funding climate action and adaptation. Promoting social inclusion Erste Group’s social impact involves its interactions with employees, customers and the broader community while establishing and maintaining good ethical compliance for building trust with stakeholders and ensuring long -term organisational stability .

For the Social and Governance aspects of ESG, Erste Group has established the following strategic priorities: — boosting financial inclusion with social banking, bringing communities closer together and strengthening social cohesion , — helping customers gain financial h ealth and literacy , — promoting diversity, including gender diversity and — fostering good ethical conduct and compliance, e.g. through extensive corruption and bribery prevention and detection trainin gs. Significant markets and customer groups Erste Group’s sustainability strategy is focused on its significant markets and customer groups and has detailed approaches c ustom- ised for each of them. More information on the set targets relating to the strategic priorities can be found in the respectiv e topical chapters. Retail In the R etail segment, most of the environmental impact stems from the buildings sector, which includes energy used for constructing, heating, cooling and lighting homes and businesses, as well as the appliances and equipment installed in them. These factors accou nt for over one third of global energy consumption and emissions. Within Erste Group and particularly in Austria, retail mortgag es contribute a large share of total assets. Erste Group has set ambitious decarbonisation targets for 2030 and 2050 to meet a 1.75- degree climate scenario for its retail mortgage portfolio starting from a 2022 baseline."

A significant part of the buildings stock in the Erste Group region is not yet ‘ climate - proof ’ due to old age of the buildings and poor insulation. An improvement can only be achieved through changes in customer behaviour, which can be influenced in the short -term by cost considerations and in the mid and long -term through regulations and availabil ity of government subsidies across all countries Erste Group is active in, which will foster further investments and improve- ments. Product offering. In the retail mortgages segment, sustainable mortgage loans have been developed and new products for renova- tion projects have been designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. To help customers meet the challenges involved in building renovation, Erste Group has developed various measures in Austria, Czechia and Croatia such as digital renovation and energy calculators, as well as an in- house team of experts to assist and advise customers on a wide variety of matters relevant to building renovation projects. Insurance linked services, either bundled with financing products or standalone, will be part of Erste Group’s overall ESG pr oposition. Cooperation with the Vienna Insurance Group contributes to closing the gap of insurance coverage for certain natural hazard risks, such as river floods. Corporates Erste Group’s Corporate segment encompass four business lines: SME, Large Corporates, Public Sector and Commercial Real Estat e (CRE). Each covers a distinct customer type with unique needs and preferences and hence specific sales and service models. Planned approach for decarbonisation . A cross -functional change initiative within Erste Group called ‘ Net Zero Business Steer- ing’, involving Risk Management , Corporate Steering and Group ESG Office defines the necessary measures to operationalise decar- bonisation targets. The planned approach for corporate business, designed to support the achievement of Erste Group’s strategic objectives of reaching net zero in 2050 consists of performing an initial client transition readiness assessment and starting an in - depth engagement process with identified clients while evaluating financing needs.

Main challenges for a green transition The main challenges ahead for Erste Group and its key stakeholders involve transitioning high -emission sectors to a low -carbon economy while maintaining financial stability. This is also connected to uncertainties in the regulatory environment and transition risks connected to it, both for Erste Group and its customers. Costs connected to a green transition can also pose additional challenges to Erste Group’s clients. Transition financing focu ses on offering renewable energy solutions such as wind, solar and hydro projects, as well as special offerings for retail mortgage clients. Erste Group expects that home renovations and renewable energy solutions will become more prominent in the future, especially through government subsidies . Possible solutions One critical solution is the client engagement toolkit, such as the Financial Health Commerical Real Estate Tool, which enables Erste Group’s relationship managers to assess the transition readiness of Erste Group’s clients in high emitting sectors (in partic ular clients under Erste Group’s decarbonisation target sectors). High -emitting sectors face significant regulatory insecurities and possible tran- sition risk. Erste Group’s relationship manag ers help to align financing strategies with sustainability goa ls.

E rste Group offers investment opportunities in green bonds and sustainable financing products. Sustainable financing products are contributin g to its 25% sustainable financing target for corporate loans by 2026. Stakeholders benefit from a transparent and strategic approach to cli- mate change mitigation, with regular monitoring and updates provided on Erste Group’s progress toward net -zero targets. Erste Group aims to provide st ability for its customers and the prescribed engagement should help foster awareness and progress. Erste Group ’s value chain composition As a bank, Erste Group ’s value chain encompasses the inflow and outflow of money, facilitating payments and transactions. The bank transforms clients’ savings and investments by making the cash available as loans while simultaneously managing the associated risks. Key business actors include Erste Group ’s clients, both private individuals and corporations, who benefit from Erste Group ’s services offered through digital and direct distribution channels. For the value chain assessment, Erste Group aimed to reflect the interests and views of affected stakeholders , as well as users of sustainability statement which are further described in SBM -2. Moreover, for the identification and assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs), special consideration was given on the upstream and downstream value chain to ensure completeness of the relevant IROs. In this context, Erste Group analysed the flow of activities, processes and value creation within the orga nisation. In the context of the double materiality assessment (DMA), Erste Group is currently limited in considering all aspects of the value chain due to data availability constraints. Therefore, the focus has been on the direct business relationships. With the implementation of EU legislation (e.g., CSRD reporting, CSDDD), Erste Group expects these limitations to be addressed, leading to more detai led value chain information in the future. Upstream The upstream value chain includes the goods and services procured by Erste Group, such as IT services, office supplies, property and infrastructure, consultancy and other external services that support the bank’s operations. Erste Group conducted an in -depth review of the costs related to purchased goods and services in the year prior to the DMA. The total expenditures were categorised by sourcing categories from Erste Group’s procurement system, with main expenditures considered for detailed assessment. Th ese categories included IT services, infrastructure software, marketing, property management, consulting and personnel management. For each expenditure category, Erste Group assessed the potential sustainability matters and IROs. For example, IT services were included in the assessment for Climate Change (E1) due to their high energy consumption, while consulting services were considered in the assessment of Workers in the Value Chain (S2). The insights from these assessments were included in the overall ev aluation.

While environmental impacts from own operations were few , material IROs were identified in the areas of Own w orkforce (S1), Consumers and e nd-users (S4) and Business conduct (G1). To ensure completeness and accuracy of these impacts, Erste Group closely aligned with the responsible departments to reflect these effects adequately in the reporting. Downstream Erste Group finances and invests in a diverse range of clients, including corporate and retail customers, institutional inves tors and stakeholders involved in its sustainability initiatives. Recognising that most of Erste Group ’s material impacts, especially regarding environmental topics, are related to its portfolio, Erste Group conducted an in -depth analysis of the portfolio. This analysis was based on the breakdown of credit exposure and the calculation of financed emissions. The IROs related to the fin anced sectors are directly reflected in the materiality assessment. For example, the highest individual sectoral exposure (real estate) is reflected in the identified material negative impact relating to financed CO 2 emissions of Erste Group.

    "text": "37 Impact, risk and opportunity management IRO- 1 – DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MATERIAL IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES For the compilation of this year’s sustainability statement Erste Group has performed a double materiality assessment (DMA) i n accordance with the requirements of ESRS 1 and 2. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requires organisations to iden- tify which sustainability matters are material. Consequently, the performed assessment covered the identification and assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) under the IFRS consolidation scope . Furthermore, other participations, which are not fully consolidated, were analysed regarding potential IROs and operational control. The outcomes of the assessment are the basis for the scope of topics reported and data points i ncluded in this statement. In 2024, the DMA process was conducted for the first time according to the ESRS. As such, it deviates from the materiality assessment of prior periods by adhering to all requirements of ESRS 1 and 2 and especially by introducing financial materiality (outside -in per- spective) as a second materiality perspective alongside the impact materiality (inside -out perspective). Additionally, connections be- tween impacts and dependencies, as well as the risks and opportunities that may arise from them have been considered in the assess-ment. Erste Group will review the materiality assessment process annually. Identification of impacts, risks and opportunities The DMA was performed under the lead of Group ESG Office, considering inputs from Group Strategy, Group Investor Relations, Group People and Culture, Group Procurement, Risk Management, Corporates and Markets and Group Accounting. Double materiality assessment process The process to identify the material impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) was conducted in four steps. As a first step a relevance analysis of all sustainability matters listed in ESRS 1 Appendix A AR 16 was conducted. Additionally, this list was enriched with the entity specific topic of financial health . If a sustainability matter was assessed as relevant, the respective IROs assigned to the topic were subsequently subject to an impact and financial materiality assessment. The final step was to validate and approve the outcome of the DMA, where the final scoring per IRO was quality assured by a central expert jury. Subsequent to these steps the results were visualised in a matrix, summarised in an executive presentation and concluded by Erste Group’s Management Board. To gain a deep understanding of the circumstances Erste Group is operating in, various data was collected for the identificat ion of IROs. Inputs for the DMA included: — Sector standards, guidance documents and peer benchmarking — Analysis of the group strategy and related business activities — Engagement with affected stakeholder groups and expert interviews — Erste Group Risk Materiality Assessment results — Mapping of sectoral credit exposures and financed emissions (Portfolio) — Spend for purchased goods and services (Upstream) — Consultation with internal expert jury and attendance of expert jury of the subsidiaries Throughout the DMA, a Top -Down approach was used to identify the material IROs .

This was done by assessing the IROs centrally for the group with a subsequent validation against the DMA results from the subsidiaries consolidated under IFRS . Consequently , in order to assure the completeness and accuracy of the DMA within Erste Group, constant communication with the subsidiaries was necessary. This was to identify and assess potentially relevant IROs at both the group and entity levels. This was achieved by: — Biweekly AT/CEE calls — Ad hoc calls or scheduled calls on a 1:1 basis (Erste Group and subsidiaries) — Workshops — Erste Group participation in the local expert juries of the subsidiaries The outcome of the DMA is the list of material IROs that is shown in SBM- 3 and lays the foundation for this report."

    "text": "38 Stakeholder Engagement The DMA was informed by internal stakeholders from various business units, e.g People & Culture, Carbon Calculation & Targeting, Data Protection Legal etc. and the Employees Council. Erste Group had no other direct consultations with other affected communities in the DMA. The assessment of the IROs was conducted by Group ESG Office & Group Accounting based on internal stakeholder dialogues . Results were validated by the Expert Jury . The Expert Jury are individuals representing Group Accounting and Group ESG Office. For the purpose of the DMA, no direct consultations with affected communities or other stakeholder groups were conducted. However, Erste Group plans on further stakeholder engagements in future years. Value Chain Assessment For the DMA, Erste Group aimed to reflect the interests and views of affected stakeholders as well as users of the sustainability statement as described in SBM -2. Moreover, for the identification and assessment of IROs, special consideration was given to the upstream and downstream value chain to ensure completeness of the relevant IROs. In this context, Erste Group an alysed the flow of activities, processes and value creation within the organisation. Further information on Erste Group ’s value chain composition and the respective implications on the DMA can be found in chapter SBM -1. Impact Materiality Assessment The assessment was based on the following central assumptions: — The value chain relevance and the time horizon of their assumed occurrence were identified per impact. — Impacts were defined as either positive or negative. If multiple but deviating impacts (i.e. positive and negative) were iden tified towards a sustainability matter, each impact was evaluated separately. — For a sustainability matter to be deemed as material, only one material impact is sufficient, regardless of the count of addi tional immaterial , its state as actual or potential, its allocated time horizon or value chain relevance. — The severity and the likelihood were evaluated for each impact. For actual impacts the likelihood was consistently set to 100 %. For potential impacts the likelihood was assessed on a scale from 0- 5. — The scoring of s everity included the three parameters of s cale, scope and i rremediab ility. Each evaluation paramater was assessed individually on a scale from 0 -5, weighted equally and multiplied by the likelihood. — Subsequent impacts and human rights impacts were considered. For human rights impacts severity took precedence over likeli- hood with a weight of 100%. — Impacts with a total score above 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 5 were considered material. — Impact evaluations were conducted under the lead of Group ESG Office and Group Accounting engaging in expert interviews with in -house representatives with group functions of identified stakeholder groups, setting scores based on evidence and/or expert opinion. — The material impacts were aligned with the outcome of the financial materiality assessment for sustainability matters whereby financial materiality would be triggered by impact materiality. — The final scoring per impact was quality assured by a central expert"

The executed process did not comprise an explicit step of engaging with external stakeholders. Information concerning affected stakeholders was considered implicitly via the above -mentioned in- house experts and their regular exchanges with externals (i.e. customers, NGOs, rating agencies, investors). For more information on stakeholder groups and engagement, please refer to chap ter SBM -2. Impacts relating to E1 Climate change The whole value chain was considered and assessed in the context of climate change. As described in section ‘ SBM -1’, some sectors with high emissions, such as IT -services, are part of Erste Group’s upstream value chain. These were assessed alongside emissions from Erste Group’s own operations. Together, the impact was considered material, especially due to the high sc ore considering the scope of CO 2 emissions, which were considered to have a global impact, as well as the irremediability, as CO 2 emissions ar e difficult to be reversed. However, a major part of Erste Group’s overall emissions stem from the financed emissions in the portfolio, which are part of its downstream value chain. As such, these are closely monitored. During Erste Group’s DMA, the current total carbon footprint ba sed on end of year 2023 values was used as input. Erste Group is calculating and reporting GHG emissions for both its banking ope rations (scope 1, 2 and 3) as well as its financed portfolio (financed scope 3 emissions). The used methodologies are in line wi th the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the PCAF methodology. Details regarding the computations and calcu- lation scope can be found in chapter E1 -6 of this statement."

    "text": "39 For the subtopic of climate change mitigation as well as in the subtopic of energy, negative impacts were identified, which, due to their actual and global nature, received the highest notch evaluation and hence were deemed material. The negative impacts i n the subtopic of energy are on the one hand driven by the energy mix consumed by Erste Group leading to CO 2 emissions (please also refer to chapter E1 -5 for details) and on the other hand, its financing of energy -intensive companies. Erste Group already finances renewable energy projects supporting the transition to an economic system within the planetary bound- aries. It does so based on its Responsible Financing Policy, which sets out financing exclusions for high emitting sectors, a s well as its Sustainable Finance Guideline which pursues targets in sustainable financing. Based on the actual and global nature this positive portfolio related impact was assessed as material. Lastly, concerning the sub -topic of climate change adaptation, the financing of adaptation solutions was assessed to be very likely in the focus of Erste Group’s future financing strategy. Given Erste Group’s overall size and its focus on the eastern part of the EU, the assessment of the significance of the effect resulted in a classification as a significant positive potential impact. the evaluation of the significance of the effect resulted in a material positive potential impact. Impacts relating to E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems In the upstream value chain, no material impacts in connection to biodiversity and ecosystems were identified. Nevertheless, Erste Group is aware that biodiversity and ecosystems is a topic of increasing importance and is closely monitoring all parts of its value chain to ensure that potential impacts are adequately managed. Erste Group has no sites (own premises) located in or near biodiversity -sensitive areas and no material impacts were identified related to Erste Group’s own operations affecting any biodiversity -sensitive areas. Concerning downstream impacts, Erste Group’s focus on financing real estate and public infrastructure projects was assessed to have a potential negative impact on biodiversity, as soil is sealed and land is degraded, causing increased flooding risks, clima te change exacerbation and possible health issues due to decreased air and water quality. Potential other impact drivers, such as depen dencies on ecosystems for certain financed sectors (such as tourism), have been considered, but were not considered mater ial due to the comparatively low exposure share. In light of these findings, the likelihood of negative impacts from already occurring financing projects was estimated to be high, while potential effects are seen to be hard to remedy. The size of Erste Group’s related portfolio, paired with the nature of the impacts on ecosystems as potentially significant and the efforts related to restoring ecosystems, led to the assessment of the impact as material. The evaluation was based on expert judgement. The material potential impacts of biodiversity and ecosyst em matters are restricted to the financed portfolio.

Impacts relating to S1 Own Workforce Erste Group places great importance on the development and support of its own employees, as they are a key factor in the company's success. Topics such as work -life balance, health and safety, gender equality and equal pay for equal work, as well as traini ng and skills development and diversity were identified as material for Erste Group. A comprehensive analysis was conducted, taking into account existing People & Culture strategies and internal policies. The assessment was based on the evaluations of internal experts and the results of existing employee surveys. Health and safety, for example, was given high priority. Further details can be found in the table in the chapter ‘ SBM -3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with Erste Group's strategy and business model ’. Impacts relating to S4 Consumers and End Users As a financial services provider, Erste Group places great importance on its responsibility towards customers and end users. The assessment of potential impacts related to the topics in this chapter - consumers and end users - was therefore carried out wit h particular care. Topics such as financial health, privacy and social banking were identified as material to Erste. The assess ment fo- cused on the direct impact on customers and end users, with a strong emphasis on the overall customer experience and the protection of their interests. A detailed assessment was conducted, taking into account existing customer policies and data protection m easures.

An analysis was performed taking Erste Group’s existing governance setup and compliance status as well as its role as a tightly supervised and regulated financial instit ution and financial services provider into account. This influenced the evaluation of the impacts. For example, the impact connected to the prevention and detection including training regarding corruption and bribery was deemed to have the highest likeliho od, as Erste Group already has rigorous practices and trainings in place. The evaluation was performed based on Erste Group’s internal expert judgment, leading to two material positive impacts in connection to the protection of whistleblowers and the prevention of corruption and bribery (see table in SBM -3). Financial Materiality Assessment The assessment was based on the following central assumptions: — For the financial materiality, risks and opportunities related to future legislation, reputation and uncertainties connected to them are taken into account. The process is connected to already existing internal risk assessments, as well as the strategic position of Erste Group to capture future business opportunities. — The identification and evaluation of risks of this year’s DMA result, consider information stemming out of Erste Group’s annu al risk materiality assessment, in which ESG risks and risk drivers where already included and evaluated due to regulatory requi re- ments. — The value chain relevance and the time horizon of their assumed occurrence were identified per risk and opportunity. — For a sustainability matter to be deemed as material, only one material risk or opportunity is sufficient, regardless of the count of additional immaterial risks or opportunities, its allocated time horizon or value chain relevance. — Identified risks and opportunities were evaluated in terms of the magnitude of their financial effect on a scale from 0 -3 and subsequently multiplied by the probability of occurrence on a scale from 0 -5. — Risks and opportunities with a total score above 1.5 on a scale from 0 to 3 were considered material. — Risks and opportunities were defined and evaluated separately under the lead of Group ESG Office and Group Accounting, en-gaging in expert interviews with in -house representatives with group functions (i.e. Group Operational Risk Management, Group ICAAP Team, Group Strategy, Business Development). The score was set individually per risk or opportunity. — The final scoring per risk and opportunity was quality assured by a central expert jury. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATING TO E1 CLIMATE CHANGE Physical risks For the means of the DMA physical risks are identified and assessed under the subtopic of climate change adaptation. Physical risks can arise at various locations throughout the value chain, such as: — Erste Group’s own fixed assets — fixed assets of suppliers (e.g. data centers) — fixed assets of customers and as a specific category thereof — those customer fixed assets that serve as collateral Due to its essential importance to Erste Group as a credit institution, the focus of the assessment was centered"

While the upstream value chain as well as Erste Group’s own assets can be affected by physical risks, the potential effect was considered to be minor compared to the downstream value chain. Acute risks can damage collateral and, together with chronic physical risks, impact the viability of business models. The assessment of the portfolio was guided by multiple inputs. The results of Erste Group’s risk materiality assessment, taki ng into account the results of the comprehensive stress -testing exercise, including a flood risk scenario, as well as the results o f a portfolio screening based on MunichRe Location Risk Intelligence data were used as the basis for the materiality assessment. More infor mation can be found in chapter E1 SBM -3. Transition risks and opportunities Transition risks and opportunities have been identified and assessed under the subtopics of climate change mitigation and ada ptation. Due to its essential importance to Erste Group as a credit institution, the focus of the assessment was centred on the financed portfolio and the transmission channel of credit risk, as transition events such as policy changes can impact the viability and profitability of customers’ business models. While risks and opportunities can arise in the upstream value chain and Erste Group’s own operations, they have been assessed to be minor compared with the financed portfolio. The evaluation of transition risks in the portfolio is taking into account the current distribution of the portfolio based on its carbon - intensity and the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) distribution across the c ommercial and residential real e state portfolio. The rationale applied in this case was that the higher the current GHG emissions, the more investments and costs are likely to be incurred for reducing emissions or improving energy efficiency, which can have a negative impact on credit quality."

Given the fact, that the decarbonisation of the portfolio also for Erste Group as a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance d edicated to Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, will be a long -term exercise, transition risks resulting out of the financed portfolio were also assessed to be prominent over all time horizons (short, medium and long -term). For further ex- planations, please refer to chapter E1 SBM -3. The evaluation of transition opportunities is taking into account the current distribution of the portfolio and the potential financial benefits of identified opportunities. This includes opportunities from financing companies investing into the decarbonis ation of their own business models and clients offering climate change adaptation solutions, for example in the real estate sector. Non- material sustainability matters Erste Group examined various topics, including pollution, water and marine resources, resource use and circular economy. In all these areas, no material IROs were identified. The assessment considered Erste Group’s business model as a financial institution and its up - and downstream value chain. The assessments indicated that the potential IROs were considered minor and non -material due to Erste Group’s non -manufacturing business model and the structure of its portfolio. E2 Pollution The upstream value chain, such as IT -providers and infrastructure software, as well as Erste Groups own operations and downstream value chain were considered in the assessment of pollution matters. As Erste Group is not a manufacturing company and has no direct reference points to pollution, potential impacts were assessed not to be material . Concerning potential risks and opportunities regarding pollution were analysed based on the current business strategy and portfolio structure. E3 Water and marine resources Similarly to pollution, potential impacts relating to water and marine resources in the upstream value chain, such as the wat er usage connected to IT services, as well as the downstream value chain were assessed. As Erste Group is not a manufacturing compa ny and as there is direct water consumption only at the bank’s office locations, impacts relating to Erste Group’s own operations ar e deemed minor. Concerning potential risks and opportunities were assessed based on the current business strategy and portfo lio structure in combination with the results of Erste Group’s risk materiality assessment and underlying ESG sector risk heatmap. E5 Resource use and circular economy Erste Groups own operations and upstream value chain were assessed together with impacts related to the financed portfolio. While Erste Group's investments in, and financing of companies that operate or manufacture machines that produce a lot of (hazardous ) waste, or are resource in -tense, have a negative impact on the state of the environment, the effect was assessed not to be"

    "text": "47 EU Taxonomy Disclosures Legal framework at EU level The European Union ’s Regulation EU 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (further referred to as the EU Taxonomy Regulation) serves as a basis for re direc ting capital flows towards sustainable economic activities and as a fundamental support for the transition to a sustainable European economy. On the one hand, this is ensured by the introduction of a uniform classification system for sustainable economic activities and on the other hand, through an introduction o f specific reporting obligations for both financial and non- financial undertakings. The EU Commission’s Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (further referred to as the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation) ad- dresses the requirement of the EU Taxonomy’s Article 8 by specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obliga- tion. Additionally, in 2021 and 2023 respectively, two further delegated regulations have been issued, establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to each of the six environmental objectives defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, as well as for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectiv es. Furthermore, the EU Commission’s Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/ 1214 provides for further disclosures as regards specific eco- nomic activities in the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors , applicable to both non -financial undertakings directly involved in such economic activities as well as financial undertakings that fund such non -financial undertakings. Applicability to credit institutions The regulated framework stipulates that to be considered environmentally sustainable (further referred to as taxonomy aligned), financings of economic activities by credit institutions ( whether in the form of term lending or non -trading investments in securities) need to be further directed by the related banking clients or issuers towards revenue -generating activities or capital expenditure that meet three additional criteria. These activities must be assessed as simultaneously (a) making a substantial con tribution ( SC) to at least one of the 6 EU environmental objectives, (b) not significantly harming other environmental objectives ( DNSH) and (c) being compliant with minimum safeguards ( MS). When, by reference to the related contractual clauses, the use of the related proceeds cannot be specifically connected to such activities or capital expenditure projects, the taxonomy alignment of the related general - purpose financings is statistically determined, i.e. through weighing by the applicable taxonomy KPIs publicly disclosed by the related banking clients or issuers. The Green Asset Ratio (GAR) is the proportion of taxonomy aligned assets or economic activities financed by Erste Group compared to the total ‘covered assets’ . Covered assets include all group assets, excluding those related to central governments, supranational issuers as well as exposures to central banks and the trading book. Covered financial assets are included in the numerator of this KPI if either the related counterparts are"

Such financial assets (provided that they are neither held for trading nor derivative assets) are further considered in the GAR numerator as follows: — in full, if the purpose of the financing is known (use of proceeds known) and the financed economic activities demonstrably meet all technical screening criteria of the classification system (e.g. project financing) and are MS compliant , or — weighed by the counterpart’s (or, if unavailable, by the counterpart’s group) most recently published t axonomy alignment KPI, if the purpose of the financing is unknown ( ‘general purpose financing ’, e.g. working capital loans). Additionally, ‘use of proceeds known ’ non- trading non- derivative financial assets that have households or local governments as coun- terparts (namely, public authority bodies or agencies other than those directly run by related country’s central government, e.g. mu- nicipalities or local councils) are also included in the GAR numerator, if the financed economic activities demonstrably meet all th e applicable technical screening criteria.

    "text": "48 Another significant KPI is the t axonomy eligibility KPI. This KPI puts the covered assets of Erste Group that are classified as t axon- omy eligible in relation to the total assets covered by the GAR. Similarly to the GAR, covered financial assets are included in the numerator of this KPI if either the related counterparts are themselves obligated to KPI disclosure at either individual or consolidated level or belong to a group headed by a n undertaking obligated to KPI disclosure . Such financial assets (if they are neither held for trading nor derivative assets) are further considered in the numerator of the t axonomy eligibility KPI as follows: — in full, if the purpose of the financing is known, and the economic activities financed are found as taxonomy eligible by corre- spond ing to the activities described in the classification system, regardless of whether all technical criteria are met (e.g. project financings), or — weighed by counterpart’s (or, if unavailable, by counterpart’s group) most recently published taxonomy eligibility KPI, if t he pur- pose of the financing is unknown (‘general purpose financing’ e.g. working capital loans). Additionally, ‘use of proceeds known’ non- trading non- derivative financial assets that have households or local governments as coun- terparts are also included in the numerator of the taxonomy eligibility KPI, if the financed economic activities demonstrably are found as taxonomy eligible by correspond ing to the activities described in the classification system, regardless of whether all technical criteria are met. Overview of Erste Group’ s Taxonomy disclosures and KPIs SCOPE OF THE PUBLISHED EU TAXONOMY REPORTING TEMPLATES Erste Group has prepared the EU Taxonomy disclosures on a consolidated basis, in accordance with the CRR consolidation scope, which is insignificantly different from Group’s IFRS scope of consolidation (as disclosed in the related Annex to this Annual Repo rt), notably in terms of impact in the consolidated taxonomy disclosures based on Group’s total consolidated assets. Therefore, wh ilst Erste Group’s total consolidated assets as at 31 December 2024 in accordance with the IFRS consolidation scope amount to EUR 353.74 billion, they amount to EUR 353.71 billion according to the CRR consolidation scope (net of related credit loss allowances in amount of EUR 4.14 billion, which are grossed -up for EU Taxonomy reporting purposes along adjustments to other balance -sheet items as further detailed in the sub -chapter ‘Reporting methodology and underlying assumptions and interpretations ’ below). This slight difference is due to a few entities qualifying as subsidiaries under the IFRS scope of consolidation only. For year -end 2024, as in year -end 2023, Erste Group, as a credit institution, applies Annex V and VI of the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation. Based on CSRD, a ll Erste Group’s sub -groups in scope of sustainability reporting as of 31 Dec ember 2024 are publishing separate (consolidated) sustainability statements.

SUMMARY OF THE PUBLISHED EU TAXONOMY REPORTING TEMPLATES ACCOMPANIED BY CONSIDERATIONS ON SELECTED YEAR -ON- YEAR DEVELOPMENTS 1 This paragraph provides a concise description of the EU Taxonomy reporting templates published by Erste Group as of 31 Decemb er 2024, simultaneously addressing the requirements of Annex XI to the EU Taxonomy Disclosures regulation with regards to qualitative explanations addressing significant developments in the main t axonomy KPIs, starting with the second year of implementation. Template 0 ‘ Summary of KPIs to be disclosed by credit institutions under Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation ’ Template 0 provides a summary of key amounts and most significant t axonomy KPIs, as further disclosed in the Templates 1, 3 or 5 (see below). According to Annex VI to the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation, Template 0 does not feature a comparative ( ‘T-1’) section Therefore, Erste Group does not create a comparative Template 0 as of 31 December 2023. However, the significant year -on- year developments in the quantitative information featured in Template 0 are further outlined below. Total environmentally sustainable assets / activities (turnover view) As of 31 December 2024, Erste Group discloses in Template 0 the total taxonomy aligned assets in amount of EUR 1 .59 billion ( ‘stock’ ). EUR 0.68 billion thereof correspond to financings of sustainable activities having been initially recogni sed during the year 2024 (‘flow ’). As of 31 December 2023, the related volumes amounted to EUR 1.25 billion and EUR 0.25 billion respectively . These amounts are disclosed in Template 0 by applying the ‘ turnover view ’, namely – as far as general -purpose financings clients or issuers obligated to KPI disclosure are concerned – by weighing the related exposures by the t axonomy KPIs published by the related undertakings in connection to their revenue -generating activities (non -financial undertakings) or financings thereof (financial undertakings).

On the other hand, taxonomy aligned financings to non- financial undertakings obligated to KPI disclosure remained stable on a year -on-year basis ( ‘stock -turnover ’ view: EUR 1.20 billion as at 3 1 December 2024 and EUR 1.24 billion as at 31 December 2023). Total environmentally sustainable assets are further detailed, notably per categories of assets and related counterparts, but also per eligibility and alignment towards each of the 6 environmental objectives within Template 1 ‘Assets for the calculation of GAR’ , disclosed in both the turnover view and the CapEx view and featuring a 1:1 ‘T -1’ (2023) comparative section. Total GAR Stock and Flow (turnover view and CapEx view) Erste Group’s total GAR (turnover view) acknowledges a favorable development from 0 .53% as at 31 December 2023 to 0. 62% as at 31 December 2024 (stock) and respectively from 0. 78% as at 31 December 2023 to 1.11% as of 31 December 2024 (flow). This increase results from the above described year -on-year positive development in total taxonomy aligned assets / activities (GAR Stock / Flow numerator amounts) and, on the other hand, despite the adverse mathematical effect from year -on-year increases in the total covered assets featured as denominator of the GAR (stock: from EUR 236.3 billion as at 31 December 2023 to EUR 255.0 billion as a t 31 December 2024; flow: from EUR 32.7 billion as at 31 December 2023 to EUR 61.1 billion as of 31 December 2024) . In the CapEx view, the corresponding favorable development is as follows : from 0 .76% as of 31 December 2023 to 1.02% as of 31 December 2024 (stock) and respectively from 1. 34% as of 31 December 2023 to 1.63% as of 31 December 2024 (flow). These positive developments in Erste Group’s Total GAR Stock and Flow as of 31 December 2024 in comparison to 31 December 2023 have occurred despite one further adverse factor, namely methodological developments and clarifications having led, inter ali a, to an inherent increase in the GAR denominator (Total GAR assets) on the back of the GAR excluded assets. Further details i n this respect are provided in the paragraph ‘ Developments in the application of EU Taxonomy disclosure requirements and summary of ef fects on the comparative information as of year -end 2023’ further down this chapter. Erste Group’s GAR Stock as of 31 December 2024 remains nevertheless inherently low (below 1% in turnover view and slightly above 1% in CapEx view), mainly due to the built -in asymmetry of the GAR (expected however to gradually reduce until 2028, along the gradual increase in scope of the CSRD, therefore of the GAR numerator eligible assets), but also to the current impracticabil ity of demonstrating, beyond any reasonable doubt, the taxonomy alignment of Group’s loans to Households, notably of mortgage loans , in particular with"

Therefore , as of 31 December 2024, Erste Group’s consolidated mortgage and building renovation loans to Households amount ing to EUR 74 .3 billion, none of which was reported as taxonomy aligned, despite most of this volume (EUR 70 .5 billion) being assessed and reported as taxonomy eligible. GAR Stock and GAR Flow are further detailed, notably per categories of assets and related counterparts, but also per eligibil ity and alignment towards each of the 6 environmental objectives within Template 3 ‘GAR KPI Stock’ and Template 4 ‘GAR KPI Flow’ respectively . These templates are disclosed in both the turnover view and the CapEx view and, as far as Template 3 is concerned, featuring a 1:1 ‘T -1’ (2023) comparative section. FinGuar KPI Stock (turnover view and CapEx view) Whilst the GAR refers to credit institution’s on -balance assets, the FinGuar KPI focuses on credit institution’s off -balance exposures. Unlike the GAR, Erste Group’s FinGuar Stock KPI has acknowledged a relative deterioration on a year -on-year basis: from 16. 22% as of 31 December 2023 to 14.20% as of 31 December 2024 (turnover view) and respectively from 19. 29% as of 31 December 2023 to 16.94% as of 31 December 2024 (CapEx view).

Erste Group’s AuM Stock KPI has acknowledged a relatively favorable year -on-year development: from 6 .78% as of 31 December 2023 to 7. 28% as of 31 December 2024 (turnover view) and respectively from 8 .01% as of 31 December 2023 to 10.83% as of 31 December 2024 (CapEx view). This positive development can be plausibly explained as being predominately due to the same main underlying reason in the positive evolution of the GAR itself . As mentioned above, this reason is the contribution into this KPI’s numerator of the financial undertakings obligated to KPI disclosure being issuers of the related (underlying) assets under management (which contribution inherently did not exist as of 31 December 2023)."

Template 2 GAR sector information This template provides, in both stock turnover view and stock CapEx view, a breakdown per the applicable NACE codes of all the eligible and aligned amounts featured in Template 1’s row 20 (non -financial undertakings obligated to KPI disclosure ), across all environmental objectives. The template does not feature a ‘T -1’ (20 23) comparative section. For readability considerations, Erste Group continues as of 31 December 2024 to apply the same presentation approach for this Template as of 31 December 2023, con- sisting of disclosing the required information at NACE sector granularity only for those NACE sectors covering, in descending order of the related total aligned amount, at least 80% of the Group’s total taxonomy aligned assets (as per the respective view). Additional disclosures addressing financings of specific Nuclear and Fossil Gas related economic activities Based on the requirements of Annex XII to the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation, Erste Group publishes as of 31 December 2024, in addition to the main t axonomy templates (0 to 5) in all the required views, six sets of five additional disclosure templates each, providing an insight into Group’s direct or indirect financings (that means: via financings to peer financial undertakings), either specific or gen eral purpose, attributable to six specific economic activities related to the Nuclear and Fossil Gas en ergy sectors. Each of the six sets of such additional tables relates to one of Group’s main t axonomy KPIs (namely: GAR, FinGuar KPI and AuM KPI), both stock and flow, in both turnover and CapEx view, as applicable. None of these templates features a ‘T -1’ (2023) section and, therefore, prior year comparatives are not provided. As a result, the overall number of distinct EU Taxonomy templates published by Erste Group as of 31 December 2024 amounts to 13 main taxonomy templates (thereof 6 featuring a ‘ T-1’ section and therefore including prior year comparative information) and a further 54 Nuclear & Fossil Gas activities -related supplementary EU Taxonomy templates (none featuring a ‘ T-1’ section and therefore none including prior year comparative information). Quantitative Nuclear & Gas templates for GAR Stock have developed as of year -end 2024 compared to year -end 2023 mainly in response to general -purpose financings to KPI -disclosure -obligated financial undertakings having been also factored in at year -end 2024, weighed by the applicable KPIs, as published for the first time by the related undertakings during the current year.

Thus, for instance, mostly due to this reason, total taxonomy -aligned on -balance financings (turnover view) attributable to the activiti es 4.26- 4.31 increased year -on-year from EUR 80 million to EUR 138 million (capex view: from EUR 80 million to EUR 201 million), increas- ing from 6,40% to 8,77% (capex view: 4,36% to 7,81%). The mentioned amounts stem entirely from general -purpose exposures, weighed accordingly by the applicable KPIs of the related counterparts . SELECTED KPIS ’ OVERVIEW As of 31 December 2024, Erste Group’s total eligibility KPI and total GAR can be summarized as follows: Turnover view — Group’s consolidated taxonomy eligible assets amount to EUR 82.66 billion (2023: EUR 74.84 billion ), representing 32.4% (2023: 31.7% ) of the total covered assets. — Group’s consolidated taxonomy aligned assets amount to EUR 1.59 billion (2023: EUR 1.25 billion ), representing 0.62% (2023: 0.53%) of the total covered assets. CapEx view — The Group’s taxonomy eligible assets amount to EUR 83. 89 billion (2023: EUR 75.71 billion), representing 32.9% (2023: 32.0%) of the total covered assets. — The Group’s taxonomy aligned assets amount to EUR 2. 60 billion (2023: EUR 1.79 billion), representing 1.02 % (2023: 0.76%) of the total covered assets."

    "text": "51 In the turnover view, the total eligibility KPI and total GAR as of 31 December 2024 are further comparatively analysed and presented in the charts below: Therefore , as of 31 December 2024, Erste Group’s total taxonomy eligibility KPI consists of the following main components: — Financing to private households to the amount of EUR 70.5 billion (2023: EUR 67.7 billion), the purpose of which corresponds to taxonomy eligible activities in the real estate and the automotive sector. — Use of proceeds known and unknown financing to non -financial undertakings to the amount of EUR 4.9 billion (2023: EUR 4.8 billion) and to financial undertakings to the amount of EUR 3. 8 billion (2023: EUR 1.2 billion), the use of proceeds unknown financing having been classified proportionately as t axonomy eligible based on the eligibility KPIs published by the respective counterparties. — Financing to local and regional governments to the amount of EUR 3.4 billion (2023: EUR 1.1 billion), the purpose of which corresponds to t axonomy eligible activities. The GAR, on the other hand, consists of use of proceeds known and unknown financing to financial and respectively non- financial undertakings to the amount of EUR 0.39 billion (2023: EUR 0 billion) and respectively EUR 1.20 billion (2023: EUR 1.24 billion), with 89.0% (2023: 81.2% ) of the combined aligned amount resulting from use of proceeds unknown financing that were classified proportionately as t axonomy aligned, based on the alignment KPIs published by the respective counterparties. GAR structural constraints and limitations in data availability The taxonomy disclosures and KPIs of Erste Group as of 31 December 2024, as well as their year -on-year development as outlined above, are inherently influenced by both structural constraints arising from both the legal design of the GAR and the restricted sco pe of the CSRD, as well as by various other data availability limitations . Such constraints and limitations are further outlined below . GAR structural constraints Due to the extensive information required to evaluate the applicable taxonomy alignment technical criteria (SC, DNSH) , as well as the MS compliance. the scope of application of the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation is limited by legislation (at EU level: CSRD) , as far as qualifying exposures to undertakings are concerned, to those that are obligated to KPI disclosure as at the current reporting year -end, as well as to any subsidiaries thereof. For Erste Group as a universal bank, this means that a signific ant part of the portfolio (small and medium -sized enterprises not CSRD -obligated or part of such a group) cannot be considered at the moment in the nu- merators of the taxonomy eligibility KPI and the GAR, with most of them expected to indefinitely qualify for the respective denomi- nators only (‘ GAR structural asymmetry ’). Additionally, general- purpose exposures to households and local governments (meaning financings of such counterparts having, as per the related lending agreements or prospectus, either no specified purpose or specified purposes other than housing or acq"

This means that general -purpose expo- sures to households and local governments, along with qualifying exposures to CSRD non -obligated undertakings, can not possibly contribute to the GAR numerator, whilst they are nevertheless included in GAR’s denominator. Limitations in data availability Retail lending Related to real estate and vehicle financing towards private households , as well as related to financings of housing or other taxonomy eligible specific -purpose projects by local governments, credit institutions are allowed to use reliable third -party evaluations with regards to the central DNSH criterion of conducting a climate risk and vulnerability assessment. Erste Group is currently wor king on integrating the physical risk data of one of the world’s leading reinsurance companies into the taxonomy evaluation process, with the tar get of applying fully fledged data and related methodologies from year -end 2025 onwards. With regards to year -end 2024 tax- onomy disclosures, Erste Group therefore continues to report all household exposures as non -aligned."

    "text": "52 Environmental objectives 3 -6 According to the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Regulation and the draft FAQs from November 2024, financial undertakings shall only publish eligibility figures for the environmental objectives 3 -6 and the amended economic activities within the objectives 1- 2. It fol- lows that Erste Group becomes obligated to publish alignment figures for the environmental objectives 3- 6 for the year ending 31 December 2025. However, considering, on the one hand, Erste Group’s relatively advanced stage of technical readiness to meet this upcoming reporting obligation and, on the other hand, the low amount of obligated clients’ related taxonomy KPIs available fo r collection and further processing in this respect, Erste Group’s EU Taxonomy disclosures as of 31 December 2024 cover already the entire set of environmental objectives for the alignment figures for general purpose loans as well. The applied client alignm ent KPIs for the environmental objectives 3 -6 have, in general, very low values, which didn’t entail any further analysis on whether the related obligated clients published them in advance of being required to do so or not. Furthermore, regarding both new and existing business with undertakings obligated to KPI reporting and local government s – despite considerable efforts to further advance the examination of individual transactions – in many cases there is still insufficient infor- mation and data basis on the customer side to determine whether these transactions can be classified as taxonomy -eligible with regards to the environmental objectives 3 -6. While the Draft Commission Notice dated 28.11.2024 has indeed provided furthe r clari- fications with regards to the related taxonomy assessment, interpreting and applying the mentioned guidance leads at the moment to relatively few ‘use of proceeds known’ financings being assigned as of 31 December 2024 as eligible by reference to these environ- mental objectives. Voluntarily disclosed estimated additional alignment of loans to households Erste Group has continued to apply last year’s approach for its related voluntary disclosures. This approach incorporates the latest pronouncements and clarifications of the regulator with respect to the EU Taxonomy disclosures by credit institutions (notabl y the Commission Notice issued in draft form on 21 December 2023 and finalised with some amendments on 8 November 2024) while being also developed in response to the above -mentioned limitations in data availability. This is particularly regards climate risk and vulnerab ility assessments applying in addressing the DNSH alignment criterion in relation to mortgage and renovation loans to Households. This is also done to provide comparative figures to Erste Group’s last year’s approach for year -end 2024, focusing on six physical risks to buildings as identified through an external scientific materiality analysis covering the regions/markets of Erste Gr oup, namely: heat stress, drought stress, fire weather stress, river floods, coastal floods and earthquake risk.

This would have resulted in a total sustainable assets’ estimated proportion into total cove red assets in amount of 3.3 % (2023: 2.6%). Erste Group continues to work proactively towards fully inc orporating all required risks The above estimation has been internally developed by selecting out of the total population of mortgage loans and renovation loans to Households reported as EU Taxonomy -eligible only those deals having been subject to eligibility screening (assignment to eligible economic activities within the real estate macroeconomic sector) at individual level and being collateralized by residential real estate assets in locations where all of the applicable six physical risks were assessed as not material. From this sub -population, only those the residential real estate collateral of which either has a category ‘ A’ energy performance certificate or, otherwise, the year of con- struction of which is 2014 or later have been further considered. Reporting methodology and underlying assumptions and interpretations (Gross) carrying amounts of assets Regarding the (gross) carrying amounts of assets represented in Template 1, the following approach was taken : — For all relevant financial assets at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI ( Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive In- come ), the cost carried forward before adjustment of value adjustments was used - regardless of the counterparty type. — For all other assets falling into lines 1 -48 of Template 1, the gross carrying amount, i.e., the amount actually accounted for and used in the CRR -consolidated IFRS FINREP balance sheet, was used. This means: — For performing debt instruments at FVPL ( Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ), the gross carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. For non -performing debt instruments at FVPL, the gross carrying amount corresponds to the fair value after the accumulation of any accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk. — For all investments in associated and joint ventures, the carrying value in accordance with IAS28/IFRS11 is used. — For all equity instruments at FVPL, the fair value is used. — For all non -financial assets (‘ collateral obtained by taking possession ’ or ‘Other categories of assets’"

This means: — For performing debt instruments at FVPL ( Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ), the gross carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. For non -performing debt instruments at FVPL, the gross carrying amount corresponds to the fair value after the accumulation of any accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk. — For all investments in associated and joint ventures, the carrying value in accordance with IAS28/IFRS11 is used. — For all equity instruments at FVPL, the fair value is used. — For all non -financial assets (‘ collateral obtained by taking possession ’ or ‘Other categories of assets’ ), the carrying amounts disclosed according to IFRS are used."

    "text": "53 CSRD- obligated financial and non -financial undertakings and use of their KPIs All companies considered to be public interest entities and employing more than 500 people at either individual or consolidated level have been obligated to report EU Taxonomy disclosures as of 31 December 2023 under the NFRD and continue to be so as of 31 December 2024 under the CSRD . Financial and non- financial undertakings, that are parents of obligated groups, must publish their KPIs on a consolidated basis. These KPIs are used for the purpose of determining Erste Group’s KPIs for qualifying exposures towards all subsidiaries of this group (‘closest reporting parent’), unless KPIs are availa ble for the specific single counterparty. Flow For the purpose of Template 4 (GAR Flow), Template 5 (FinGuar Flow and AuM Flow), as well as for retrieving the ‘flow’ views of the Nuclear & Gas templates, ‘flow’ has been defined as a sub -set of ‘stock’, limited to related asset deals’ having been initia lly recog- nised during the current reporting date. The two exceptions to this approach are as follows: — Non -financial assets and financial assets not having the nature of loans and advances, debt securities or equity instruments: ‘fl ow’ has been deemed zero. — Underlying debt securities and equity instruments in off -balance investment funds or other portfolios under management: ‘flow’ has been to be arise from any positive year -on-year net increase in the number of units held at underlying ISIN level, within eac h relevant investment fund or other portfolio under management. Significant notes for the consideration of assets in Template 1 Accepted for the numerator of the GAR and therefore relevant for the taxonomy eligibility or alignment review are non -trading loans and advances, debt securities, equity instruments having financial or non- financial undertakings obligated to KPI disclosure as coun- terparties (or subsidiaries thereof), as well as real estate and car financing to private households, use of proceeds known financing with local governments and real estate collateral obtained through taking possession. Financial and non- financial undertakings — Qualifying a ssets in relation to financial and non- financial undertakings are included in the numerator of the GAR if the direct counterparty of or subsidiary of a group obligated to KPI disclosure. — Financing to financial and non- financial undertakings not obligated to KPI disclosure , which are not part of a group obligated to KPI disclosure , were considered in the denominator , irrespective of their domicile (EU or Non -EU) — Financing to Multilateral Development Banks listed in the paragraphs in Article 117(1), or Article 117(2) Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR) are considered credit institutions according to the clarifications of the ‘ Environmental Act ’ and are allowed for the numerator provided they are based in the EU.

Developments in the application of EU Taxonomy disclosure requirements and summary of effects on the comparative information as of year -end 2023 As of year -end 2024, the following changes are included in the EU Taxonomy reporting templates: 1. Consideration of loans to Households, other than those fulfilling the conditions to be reported in Template 1’s (GAR Template ’s) either of the rows 25 (‘ of which loans collateralised by residential immovable property ’), 26 (‘of which building renovation loans’) or 27 (‘of which motor vehicle loans’) As of 31 December 2024, Template 1 features such loans in the row 24 (‘Households’) column a, that means within the section ‘ GAR - Covered assets in both numerator and denominator ’. As of 31 December 2023, in accordance with the prevailing interpretation and practice applied back then, Template 1 featured such loans (as of that date, in total amount of 26.8 EUR billion) in the row 47 (‘ Other categories of assets’) column a, that means within the section ‘ Assets excluded from the numerator for GAR calculatio n (covered in the denominator) ’ 2. Consideration of general -purpose financings to Local Governments As of 31 December 2024, Template 1 features such financings in the row 30 ( ‘Other local government financing ’) column a, that means within the section ‘ GAR - Covered assets in both numerator and denominator ’. As of 31 December 2023, Template 1 featured such financings (as of that date, in total amount of EUR 4.7 billion) in the row 50 ( ‘Central governments and Supranational issuers ’) column a, that means within the section ‘ Assets not covered for GAR calculation ’. This change has been triggered by amendments in European Commission’s Third Commission Notice / 08.11.2024 ( FAQ 47 ). 3. Consideration of the proportions ‘ % coverage over total assets’ and ‘ % of assets excluded from the numerator of the GAR ’ As of 31 December 2024, Template 0 displays these proportions as follows: — ‘% coverage over total assets’: as ratio between ‘Total GAR assets’ (Template 1 row 48 column a) and ‘Total assets’ (Template 1 row 53 column a) — ‘% of assets excluded from the numerator of the GAR ’: as ratio between ‘ Assets excluded from the numerator for GAR calculation (covered in the denominator) ’ (Template 1 row 32 column a) and ‘Total assets’ (Template 1 row 53 column a) As of 31 December 2023, in accordance with the prevailing interpretation and practice applying back then, Template 0 displayed these proportions as follows: — ‘% coverage over total assets’: as ratio between ‘ GAR - Covered assets in both numerator and denominator ’ (Template 1 row"

Transitioning to net zero, based on science -based decarboni- sation pathways, is crucial for long -term wellbeing, financial stability and overall prosperity. Committed to the Paris Climate Agree- ment, Erste Group joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in November 2021. Erste Group’s double materiality analysis (DMA) identifies climate change as a key issue affecting its business and stakehold ers. As a leading provider of financial services, Erste Group aims to address the impact of its own operations and its financing an d investment activities on climate change.

Each scenario models different assum ptions about the timing and intensity of climate policy actions and technological developments: the Net Zero 2050 scenario represen ts an orderly path to net -zero emissions by 2050, while the Below 2°C scenario achieves climate goals but with less ambitious timing. In contrast, the Hot House World scenario assumes minimal climate action, leading to severe physical risks. Physical risk analytical framework: scenario overview For the assessment of physical risks, including extreme weather events and gradual climatic changes, Erste Group employs the Rep- resentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These internationally recogni sed scenarios provide standardi sed trajectories of greenhouse gas concentrations, enabling robust modelling of potential climate outcomes under various emission pathways. The RCP framework encompasses multiple scenarios, from ambi- tious climate action and low emissions (e.g., RCP 2.6) to high -emission pathways with limited mitigation measures (e.g., RCP 8.5). The scenario labelling does not correspond to the temperature increase; for instance, scenario RCP 4.5 corresponds to a tempe rature increase of 2.1 to 3.5°C in the long -term. Transition risk: selected scenario analysis After testing and analysing all four scenarios, t he Delayed Transition scenario is selected and applied in the subsequent in -depth analysis laid out in this statement, as global mitigation efforts in line with a Net Zero 2050 scenario are not materialising , but high - emissions scenarios such as the Hot Ho use World may very well still be preventable. The Delayed Transition scenario examines the implications of a rapid, disorderly transition to a low -carbon economy, characterised by sudden policy changes and market disrup- tions as countries rush to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to well below 2°C. The scenario analysis pre- sented here focuses on disorderly transitioning as a downside risk assessment tool. As such, it aims to evaluate potential fi nancial impacts in adverse conditions and does not represent Erste Group’s baseline view on future development. Physical risk: selected scenario analysis Following consultation with climate science experts from the Wegener Centre for Climate and Global Change at the University o f Graz, Erste Group has currently identified the RCP 4.5 scenario as the most appropriate framework for their climate risk anal ysis. This intermediate emissions pathway has been selected based on thorough evaluation of current global climate trajectories and policy developments. The assessment indicates that while more optimistic scenarios such as RCP 2.6 are no longer feasible given the current pace of global climate action, high- emissions pathways like RCP 8.5 seem less realistic given current global emission reduction targets.

The RCP 4.5 scenario models feasible reduction efforts and provides a realistic baseline for strategic plan ning. Scope of the resilience analysis Erste Group conducts an extensive assessment of the resilience of its business model to climate -related and environmental risks as an integral part of the strategic planning and risk management process. The identification and analysis of current and probab le future developments is done from both perspectives (1) impact on risk profile and (2) business opportunities. The resilience assessment is performed by considering both transition and physical risks in two key internal processes, namel y the Business Environment Scan (BES) and the Risk Materiality Assessment (RMA). Furthermore, business model resilience to CE risks is assessed by integration of physical risks in the Collateral Management Framework. Erste Group also assesses these risks at the client level through an ESG questionnaire and integrates them into the risk analysis of the credit application process. The scope of the resilience analysis encompasses the most significant parts of Erste Group’s portfolio and own operations, making it representative of its business model. Scope for transition risk evaluation: — clients including large corporates, SMEs and real estate (commercial real estate including income producing residential real estate and retail mortgages) — Erste Group’s own operations Scope for physical risk evaluation: — loans collaterali sed by real estate (commercial real estate including income producing residential real estate and retail mortgages) — Erste Group’s own and outsourced operations (i.e. headquarters and branches incl. critical facilities like data centres) Beyond collaterali sed assets, physical risk assessment is planned to be extended also to large corporate customers and will rely on the availability of geolocation data for clients’ assets (i.e. major production sites). The process of collecting such geolocation data is cur- rently under consideration. Once this data becomes available, the assessment of physical risks will be further enhanced.

    "text": "160 — long -term: more than 5 years (for transition risk up to 2050, for physical risks up to 2100) Physical risks from climate change are expected to materiali se in credit risk starting from the middle of the century. Consequently, the short - and medium- term horizons show similar outcomes, with substantial differences becoming more apparent in the long -term horizon (2050 and beyond). To emphasi se the importance of a long -term outlook, Erste Group has implemented an additional time horizon (2050 -2100). This horizon applies to physical risks and allows Erste Group to develop a comprehensive understanding o f future risks and to increase preparedness for the full spectrum of climate -related physical risks. Description of the resilience analysis The resilience analysis starts with the Business Environment Scan (BES) identifying potential threats or opportunities result ing from the transition to a climate -neutral economy or due to physical risks. The main objective of the BES is to offer a comprehensive un- derstanding of the changes in the operational environment, the drivers , CE risk events and the resulting implications for Erste Group’s clients, assets, real estate and overall business model. The sub -portfolio(s), business lines and industry secto rs as well as regions or geographic areas, which may be exposed to elevated risks, are identified based on scientific and socioeconomic research as well as technological and demographic trends. This approach is also used to pinpoint areas where emerging trends and changes in the operational environment can generate new business opportunities. The resilience analysis for the transition risk is performed based on scenario analysis and the impacts of transition risk dr ivers on Erste Group through key risks from its inventory (credit, market, liquidity, operational, strategic and reputational risk) . The scenarios employed to assess transition risk are informed by NGFS but internally adapted to reflect the specifics of Erste Group’s busi ness model, drawing on insights from the BES across relevant sectors (industries) and portfolios. While the overall framework follows the intergovernmental bodies’ and standard -setters’ vision of a delayed transition, details – such as narrative elements, risk parameters and transmission channels – are refined to reflect the characteristics of Erste Group’s business model and clients, as well as the operational and geographic context. Additionally, the scenario incorporates an extra layer of downside risk assumptions for societal transitions unrelated to climate, i.e. environmental risks, acknowledging that such shifts could realistically occur alongside climate transition efforts. The methodology for the transition risk assessment focuses on the impact of increasing (shadow) carbon prices on the financial position of counterparties. This (shadow) carbon price encompasses a multitude of risk drivers related to transition risk and is ther e- fore a prudent way to quantify the risk impact. The modelling reflects the direct impact of a higher carbon price on counterparties as well as the indirect effects of macroeconomic developments.

The macroeconomic parameters were derived from the regul atory sce- narios as well as the economic research department of Erste Group and cover each critical sector individually in a projection of the gross value added. The developments are based on each scenario’s narrative tailored to the current economic starti ng points of key markets. Critical assumptions on developments are therefore aligned to regulatory as well as scientific scenarios. The impact of physical risks is assessed based on MunichRe data as the primary source. The most relevant physical risks for r eal estate in the core region of Erste Bank were defined in cooperation with experts from the Wegener Centre for Climate and Global Change, University of Graz. They include heat stress, drought stress, fire weather stress, river floods and coastal floods. Erste Group’s RMA framework systematically evaluates the impact of climate and environmental risk drivers on various risk typ es, including credit, operational, market, liquidity, strategic and reputational risks. This analysis is conducted at two levels: first, by examining client portfolios and business segments and second, by assessing own operations as well as key suppliers such as da ta centres and outsourcing partners. When assessing client portfolios, one of the primary risk metrics is the potential effect on expected credit loss (ECL). ECL estimates potential future losses by considering both the borrowers’ probability of default and the potential amount lost in such events. In the context of resilience analysis, ECL allows for the quantification of future credit losses arising from climate and environmental risks under various future scenarios. For Erste Group’s own operations, the impact is simulated on the profit and loss (P&L) statement, as it provides a comprehensive measure of financial performance by capturing both revenues and expenses, thereby helping to iden tify how CE risks could affect overall profitability. The evaluation of transition risks is based on insights from the transition risk scenario analysis. More specifically, downside scenario analysis is used to assess potential financial impacts if the transition of the economy unfolds in a disorderly fashion. The physical risk assessment combines quantitative analyses, utili sing MunichRe’s climate risk data and the results from internal stress testing programmes, which simulate extreme climate scenarios to evaluate portfolio resilience.

At the core of the assessment of the resilience of Erste Group’s business model to CE risks also lies the inclusion of the im pact assessment of physical risks on the real estate taken as collateral for loans issued by the group. The value of real estate u sed by clients as collateral for loans is adjusted based on the property’s exposure to CE risks. The value of this collateral influences the risk associ- ated with the loans it secures, and this level of risk is reflected in the risk -weighted assets (RWA). In terms of collateral management, to account for future climate risks in property valuation, a reasonable timespan for the assessment of physical risks is necessary. The 20- year period around 2050 (2041- 2060) is considered the most appropriate, given the lending standards of Erste Group. Within this period, the difference in climate projections between moderate emission scenarios (RCP 4.5) and the high emission scenario (RCP 8.5) shows no significant deviation. Results of the resilience analysis The outcomes of the resilience analysis are as follows: Transition Risk — Credit Risk: The analysis conducted by Erste Group indicates notable exposure to transition -induced credit risk across all time horizons in case the transition to low -carbon economy occurs disorderly . The transition risk on the credit risk exposure is driven largely by climate -related factors and drivers such as environmental taxation and subsidies, regulatory requirements, energy and transport policies, behavioural changes of investors, consumers, su ppliers and employees as well as technological developments, while non- climate related drivers are immaterial. Looking toward s medium and long -term time horizons, these transition risks intensify, with impacts gradually spreading across an expanding range of sectors. This scenario and its impact do not reflect Erste Group’s most likely or baseline scenario, but serve as exploratory analysis to assess the exposure to transition risk in the event disorderly and abrupt manner. Under the baseline or orderly transition scenario, the direct impact of the transition risk drivers on Erste Group is significantly smaller and limited. — Operational Risk: From an operational risk perspective, two of the most relevant transition risk drivers have been identified in the medium - and long -term horizon. First, there is an increased risk of regulatory non -compliance due to rapidly evolving ESG requirements and heightened regulatory oversight. Second, shifting behaviours and expectatio ns of stakeholders (consumers, suppliers and employees) regarding environmental performance create additional operational challenges that require careful management. Both factors contribute materially to the overall operational risk profile. — Market, Liquidity and Reputational Risk: The evaluation concluded that no material transition risks were identified across al l time horizons – short -, medium - and long -term. Physical Risk — Credit and Strategic Risk: According to Erste Group’s assessment, physical risks are a material driver for long -term credit and strategic risk. This projection"

Physical Risk — Credit and Strategic Risk: According to Erste Group’s assessment, physical risks are a material driver for long -term credit and strategic risk. This projection is based on forecasts indicating that (predominantly) climate -related physical hazards will mate ri- alise and intensify from the mid -century onwards, thereby impacting the portfolio and strategic position of Erste Group. However, in the short - and medium- term, physical risks are considered immaterial due to Erste Group’s limited exposure to regions or sectors that are particularly vulnerable. — Operational Risk: For internal operations, Erste Group identifies physical risks as a material driver in the mid -term, primarily due to the potential for river floods to impact facilities in Austria, Croatia, Slovakia and Serbia. Looking further ahead, up to the year 2100, heat waves threaten to pose substantial challenges to operations in Romania, Croatia and Serbia. — Market, Liquidity and Reputational Risk: The evaluation concluded that no material physical risks were identified across all time horizons – short -, medium- and long -term. Decarbonisation strategy — Erste Group’s current decarbonisation strategy is well aligned to NGFS scenarios ‘Net Zero 2050’ and ‘Below 2°C’. The strateg y also performs well in the NGFS scenario ‘Delayed Transition’. The established decarbonisation pathways for key sectors affected by transition risk help mitigate Erste Group’s credit losses from climate and environmental risks. This aligns with the Paris Agree- ment’s Net Zero 2050 scenario. Further information on the established decarbonisation pathways can be found in chapter E1- 4. Erste Group has strengthened risk management processes by embedding CE factors into the core underwriting and collateral man- agement frameworks. To mitigate physical risks, Erste Group continuously monitors and reports on collaterals, focusing on cou ntries with very high risk. Furthermore, Erste Group has updated its collateral policy to include detailed guidelines for assessing increased physical risks in both residential and commercial real estate valuations.

    "text": "162 two risk types are considered materially exposed to transition risk in at least one time horizon. This section highlights the mechanisms through which transition risks impact Erste Group’s business, including the specific pathways and risk factors that inf luence credit and operational risk profiles. By doing so, Erste Group ensures transparency and demonstrates a commitment to robust risk man age- ment practices in the face of evolving environmental challenges. Erste Group identified several climate -related transition events from the fields of politics and economics, market participant behavior and technological development and these impacts were considered on the probability of default, loss given default, risk -weighted assets and expected credit loss For each risk driver, impacts have been identified for each customer segment and for own operations: Large corporates and SMEs. Regulatory requirements and environmental taxation significantly increase operational and capital expenditure for corporates. This results in higher default probabilities and increased credit risk, especially for industries with high exposure to carbon -intensive activities. Real estate (commercial real estate including income producing residential real estate and retail mortgages). Market sentiment and rising renovation costs, driven by energy and transport regulations, create income vulnerabilities for househol ds. These pressures lead to greater difficulties in meeting loan obligations, increasing default probabilities and associated credit losses, particularly for low -income households. Own Operations. For Erste Group’s own operations, regulatory requirements and climate -related compliance obligations increase operational expenditures, such as investments in IT systems and sustainability reporting capabilities. Additionally, reputati onal risks stemming from stakeholder expectations regarding environmental performance and competitive pressures from sustainability -fo- cused peers may further elevate credit and strategic risk. Through this framework, Erste Group systematically evaluates and manages credit risk across all customer segments, ensuring r esil- ience in its portfolio while addressing the financial impacts of transition risk. The selected scenario applied by Erste Group to evaluate transition risk is broadly based on the NGFS scenario ‘delayed trans ition’ and its respective working hypothesis of a society first doing too little to mitigate climate change and then pushing with severe effort to reach a net zero society. Hence, this scenario is more adverse than an ‘orderly transition’ which suffers much less stress due to an organised effort of society to reach the net zero target with a longer potential transition period for econ omies. In the delayed transition scenario, the stress is expected to increase due to firms continuing to struggle to decarbonise or to transition, needing higher invest-ment volumes to switch their business model to more sustainable technologies. This will have continued effects on their financial position and creditworthiness, particularly on CO 2e-intensive ‘brown’ industries, which are less prepared to adapt quickly. Erste Group added to the ‘Delayed Transition’ scenario an immediate shock of carbon prices in 2025. This way the potential worst impact in short -term horizon was simulated. By doing so, an adverse but plausible scenario was adopted while also creating the conditions to calculate the quantitative impact in the amount of EUR 771"

This will have continued effects on their financial position and creditworthiness, particularly on CO 2e-intensive ‘brown’ industries, which are less prepared to adapt quickly. Erste Group added to the ‘Delayed Transition’ scenario an immediate shock of carbon prices in 2025. This way the potential worst impact in short -term horizon was simulated. By doing so, an adverse but plausible scenario was adopted while also creating the conditions to calculate the quantitative impact in the amount of EUR 771 million for the p re-defined short -term horizon. A similar approach was already taken in the ECB Climate Stress Test of 2022, which assessed the financial stability of the EU financial system, under-scoring the prudence of selecting this scenario. The materiality of the risk is determined by comparing the increase in expected credit loss (ECL) in the accelerated delayed transition scenario to a defined threshold of 1.75% of Pillar 2 capital. The results are then categori sed as either ‘material’ or ‘immaterial’ across the three -time horizons. To determine the potential ECL increase, Erste Group conducted a simulation of the effects on transition risk on the ECL on a gross basis. This means that impact calculations exclude a ny management actions or mit igation efforts. However, in practice, the bank has made significant efforts to mitigate transition risk, inter alia, by setting decarbonisation targets. The calcu-lated ECL increase represents the potential financial effect contingent only on a sensitivity analysis of the accelerated delayed tran- sition scenario and is not considered in the IFRS 9 ECL. The 1.75% -threshold of Pillar 2 capital is exceeded for every considered time horizon, indicating that the simulated risk on a gross basis, i.e. before mitiga tion actions, is material. Besides the conducted materiality assessment of transition risk, the Forward -Looking Best -Estimate Weighted Average Carbon In- tensity (WACI) offers insights into Erste Group’s exposure to transition risks across different climate scenarios.

Real estate- related assets by their energy efficiency levels The following table provides a detailed breakdown of Erste Group’s real estate collaterals in terms of carrying value, categorised by energy efficiency levels based on two primary metrics. The first metric, the Energy Performance (EP) Score, measures the ener gy efficiency of the asset or collateral in kilowatt -hours per square meter (kWh/m²), wi th exposure values grouped into defined ranges. The second metric, the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Labels, classifies assets based on their energy efficienc y rating from A (highest efficiency) to G (lowest efficiency). Additionally, the table provides a geographical split (EU and non EU -area) and also highlights assets without an official EPC label, for which an estimated EP score (kWh/m²) is provided . When presenting the exposure distribution per EPC label, the estimated EPC labels are not taken into consideration."

    "text": "166 Transition risk – assets Based on the delayed transition scenario and its impact expressed in terms of additional expected credit loss in the long -term horizon, Erste Group conducted an additional assessment to gain valuable information about the portion of the credit portfolio currently exposed to material transition risk. For this pu rpose, the gross impact (i.e. without consideration of any mitigating actions) was cal- culated on client level and subsequently compared to a dedicated threshold derived from the pre -defined threshold on total level (1.75% of Pillar 2) leading to a (im)mate riality -classification of all clients in scope of the scenario analysis (Large corporates, SMEs and real estate (commercial real estate including income producing residential real estate and retail mortgages). In case a client is deemed to be materially exposed to transition risk, the total gross carrying amount of this client is the n split into respective maturity buckets with the three time horizons defined as described previously. The scenario analysis presented here fo- cuses on disorderly transitioning as a downside risk assessment tool. As such, it aims to evaluate potential financial impacts in adverse conditions and as such does not represent Erste Group’s baseline view on future development. The following table provides information on the share of assets at material transition risk as percentage of total assets in scope of the scenario analysis conducted based on data as of 30 June 2024 for the purpose of the risk materiality assessment. The scenario analysis covered assets of EUR 179.826 million in the half year 2024 and the coverage would have been almost identical had it been exe cuted at year end 2024. Considering the maturity of deals on client level, the data is further broken down by maturity buckets pro rata in line with the pre -defined time horizons described above.

By nature, the mitigation effect cannot reduce the risk of the transition to an immaterial level, since there will still be significant upheaval in the economy which has indirect macroeconomic effects on Erste Group’s well -diversified business model. Nonet heless, mitigation measures can substantially reduce the impact and allow management to contain the risk in line with the ambition le vel of the targets set. Additionally, the ongoing implementation of a business strategy as well as a number of (pro -) activ e risk manage- ment components give Erste Group a platform to effectively manage and reduce exposure to transition risks. It is important to note that impacts presented in the table above are potential and come from adverse scenario and as such do not represent Erste Group’s baseline anticipation. Under the baseline scenario, i.e. transition to low -carbon economy in an orderl y fash- ion, the potential direct impact is limited. PHYSICAL RISKS As a result of the physical risk assessment, the anticipated financial effects of material physical risks have been quantifie d to provide a comprehensive overview of potential impacts on asset values and operational costs. Erste Group conducted an assessment using the RCP 4.5 scenario, which is regarded as the most realistic under current climate policies. This scenario assumes moderate greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts with emissions peaking around 2040, follow ed by a gradual decline through a mix of renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements, while maintaining some fossi l fuel usage in line with current global commitments and energy trends. The year 2050 was chosen as the central anchor point for this assessment, as it aligns broadly with the average remaining eco nomic lifespan of real estate assets financed by Erste Group, which generally ranges from 20 to 40 years. Physical risks influence collateral value by reducing marketability and increasing operational and adaptation costs for real estate, with their effects expected to materi- alise predominantly from the middle of the century onwards. Erste Group assesses physical risks within its portfolio and own assets on geocoordinate -level. This approach allows for a detailed risk analysis to assign risk scores to specific locations, rather than relying on generali sed regional data. The Corporate Sustainability"

    "text": "167 Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires aggregation on a regional level using the Nomenclature des Unités territoriales statistiq ues (NUTS) 3 regions, but Erste utili ses geocoordinate -level analysis to ensure more accurate risk assessments, capturing the diversity and unique vulnerabilities of asset locations across core markets. To assess the physical risk related to collaterals, Erste Group applied a bottom -up approach. This approach begins with assessing the impact of physical risks, such as climate -related damaging events, on the level of each individual property financed and/o r used as real estate collateral for lending products. For instance, Erste Group examines how the market value of a property may be aff ected by high risk of flooding or extreme weather. Properties constructed in a location linked to very high risk usually undergo on -site inspections to identify and document any miti- gated risks, which can then be used to adjust their valuations. These individual property assessments are then aggregated to under- stand the overall risk of Erste Group’s entire real estate portfolio. Physical risk exposure Erste Group discloses the financial effects on assets at material physical risk, expressed as net carrying amount, under the RCP 4.5 Year 2050 scenario for both its own assets and real estate taken as collateral. The disclosure distinguishes between two ca tegories of risks: acute and chronic. Acute risks, which include fire weather, river floods, earthquakes and drought stress, are sudden events that can cause immediate damage. Chronic risks, such as sea level rise and heat stress, develop gradually over ti me. For Erste Group, sea level rise is particularly relevant only for Romania and Croatia due to their coastlines, while all other identified risks ap ply to the entire group. The following two tables present a detailed geographical breakdown of Erste Group’s physical risk exposures, encompassing both own assets and financed collaterals. The analysis segments exposures by temporal maturity buckets and distinguishes between a cute and chronic physical climate risks across all countries of operations. Assets are deemed to be at material physical risk when the risk score assigned by MunichRe for a particular location is classified as either ‘high’ or ‘very high’. Physical risk – own assets The following table presents the carrying amounts of Erste Group’s own assets, highlighting those at material physical risk.

Hence, only a very limited part of the total own assets is exposed to material physical risk. The exposure to material physi cal risks is further segmented into maturity buckets, which in the case of own assets denote the remaining economic lifetime of the asset. Geographically, Austria represents the largest part of own assets being exposed to material physical risk, which can be attri buted to the strong market presence with a strong branch network throughout the country. Following Austria, Romania and Hungary are the countries with the highest share in terms of risk exposure. Notably, most exposures are classified as facing acute physical r isks, pre- dominantly from river flooding, with only a small portion (9.18% of own assets at material physical risks) facing bot h acute and chronic risks.

Geographically, Austria stands out as the area with the highest share of exposure exposed to material physical risk, which is attributed to the operational focus of Erste Group’s operations in this region, followed by Romania and Slovakia. From a risk cate gorisation perspective, 94.44% of assets exposed to material physical risk are impacted by acute physical risks, predominantly due to river flood- ing. An immaterial amount of the exposed assets faces both acute and chronic risks, as is the case for pure chr onic physical risks, the latter primarily stemming from sea level rise. The above exposure is primarily concentrated in long -term maturities, which account for 74.54% (EUR 19.5 billion) of the total assets exposed to material physical risk.

E1-2 – POLICIES AND TRANSITION MEASURES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION Erste Group ’s policies to transition to a sustainable economy focus on targets for investment and financing activities, which are en- dorsed and supported by the management of all subsidiaries. Erste Group is dedicated to the objectives of the Paris Climate A gree- ment and became a member of the NZBA in November 2021. It prioriti ses sectors that benefit the most from a transition comprising real estate, electricity production, heat and steam production, oil and gas extraction, automotive extraction, iron and steel production and cement production. Erste Group is within scope of the EU Paris -aligned benchmarks, which have the primary goal of assisting the transition towards a low-carbon economy and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre -industrial level. Erste Group’s targets are already com- patible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1.75°C. Furthermore, Erste Group will phase out coal financing by 2030 and in alignment with the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) in its core markets. The targets are implem ented by internal ex perts following external guidelines, but without external verification. Furthermore, scope 1 and 2 emissions are monitored from high - emission clients operating in sectors not yet covered by decarbonisation targets."

With these targets, Erste Group pursues a consistent reduction approach towards net zero across all scopes, which is compatible with the Paris Agreement. For further information on the scenarios and methodologies used for target setting please refer to chapter ‘E1 -4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaption’. DECARBONISATION LEVERS AND KEY ACTIONS Portfolio decarbonisation levers and key actions Given their significance to Erste Group’s portfolio and their overall emission intensity, two decarbonisation levers, includi ng several key actions, have been implemented for the energy and real estate sectors to achieve Erste Group’s Net Zero portfolio decarbonisation targets. Decarbonisation lever ‘Emission reduction in the energy sector’. The first decarbonisation lever focuses on reducing financed emissions within the energy industry. Erste Group supports its customers in their efforts to optimi se their existing technology mix and investing in new plants that utili se renewable energy sources. Thus, two key actions for Erste Group are the financing of renew- able projects and reducing financings in coal -related activities. More details can be found in chapter E1 -3. Decarbonisation lever ‘Promoting a sustainable real estate sector’. The financed emissions of Erste Group’s portfolio are fur- ther reduced by directing its investments into sustainable real estate. Erste Group promotes building renovations and the installation of heating and cooling systems powered by renewable energies. Erste Group aims to attain its target by offering a commercial real estate financial health tool as well as a renovation financing and energy efficiency calculator to private individuals. Mo re details can be found in chapter E1 -3. Own operations decarbonisation lever and key actions Erste Group also takes responsibility for the emissions that lie within its direct control in their own banking operations. T hus, another decarbonisation lever was established that encompasses several key actions. Decarbonisation lever ‘Emission reduction in own operations’. The lever focuses on key activities such as switching to low carbon energy sources, decarboni sing employee mobility and conducting employee engagement and awareness training to promote sustainable behaviour. More details can be found in chapter E1 -3. EMBEDMENT IN STRATEGY As part of its ambition to support the transition to a sustainable economy, Erste Group aims to guide clients and sectors towards decarbonisation and achieving net zero targets, while also reducing emissions from its own operations. This plan is fully integrated into Erste Group ’s overall business strategy and financial planning, ensuring that decarbonisation efforts are part of core decision - making processes.

EMBEDMENT IN STRATEGY As part of its ambition to support the transition to a sustainable economy, Erste Group aims to guide clients and sectors towards decarbonisation and achieving net zero targets, while also reducing emissions from its own operations. This plan is fully integrated into Erste Group ’s overall business strategy and financial planning, ensuring that decarbonisation efforts are part of core decision - making processes. It emphasi ses continuous engagement with clients across various industries to support their transi tion and man- age climate -related risks. The client engagement process has three phases: assessment, engagement and financing, steering and mon- itoring. Assessment phase. Erste Group assesses where clients stand in their transition journey, using data reported by clients or collected through the ESG client assessment. It is working on classifying its clients according to their transition readiness. This hel ps identify clients most in need of transition financing. Engagement and financing phase. Erste Group engages with clients using a strategy tailored to their maturity in the transition journey. Erste Group evaluates their transition plans, contextualises them with the sector’s decarbonisation targets and ensu res align- ment with the sustainable finance guidelines (SFG). It plans to engage with relevant clients especially in the coal, oil and gas indus-tries by 2026. Erste Group integrates emission reduction targets into its business strategy to direct capital to sectors and clients with the highest transition potential, supporting both the clients’ transition and the bank’s sustainability goals. Steering and monitoring phase. Erste Group monitors portfolio developments and client progress quarterly. This process includes assessing the impact of client engagements, adjusting strategies and implementing necessary measures. Progress is reported re gularly to the Management Board and Supervisory B oard. Additionally, this steering process influences Erste Group’s business planning by incorporating lessons learned and adjusting exposure targets and emission intensity forecasts, ensuring alignment with ind ustry trends and local regulatory requirements."

    "text": "171 SUSTAINABLE FINANCE GUIDELINE (SFG) Policy objectives to address impacts, risks and opportunities Erste Group’s primary environmental impact stems from its lending activities, specifically the emissions generated by the pro jects it finances. As a financial institution, Erste Group plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition to a low -carbon econ omy by actively engaging with its clients and supporting them on their decarbonisation journey. Considering the climate crisis, this means to mobilise funds to create a fairer and more prosperous world for all, thereby contributing to a sustainable future. By adhering to its SFG, Erste Group will continue to maintain its strong role in sustainable financing, with focus on climate change mitigation and financi ng of energy -efficient buildings and renewable energy as well as potentials arising from the other en vironmental objectives (climate change adaptation) (for more details see chapter SBM -1). The Sustainable Finance Guideline, and thus Erste Group’s sustainable financings , is a strategy that primarily addresses its opportu- nities and positive impacts and, under certain conditions, may contribute to its decarbonisation targets, such as: — Additional financial opportunities arise from Erste Group’s investments in and financing of customers supporting their decar- bonisation and transition to a sustainable state. — Erste Group’s financing of renewable energy projects enables CO 2e-neutral energy production, which is necessary for the transi- tion to an economic system within the planetary boundaries. — Erste Group’s financing of and investments in renewable energy projects (e.g. energy from renewable energy sources such as solar energy or wind power) enable CO 2e-neutral energy production and offers new opportunities for the portfolio. — Through the financing of climate -change adaptation solutions, Erste Group has a positive impact on reducing vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are available in chapter E1 -6. Methodology ‘Sustainable financing’ is a term used by Erste Group to determine financings that address the interplay of Erste Group’s identified environmental impacts and opportunities. This involves screening and evaluating Erste Group’s financed portfolio in a ccordance with a bespoke approach and set of criteria, grounded in the principles of established standards and frameworks. With the dec arbon- isation levers of ‘ promoting a sustainable real estate sector ’ as well as the ‘reduction of financed emissions in the ener gy sector ’, Erste Group’s sustainable financings have a primary focus on: Real estate financings: — energy efficient buildings with energy -efficient indicators in the Energy Performance Certificate (e.g. EPC label A) — buildings meeting the requirements for a ‘nearly zero energy building’ (NZEB) according to EU Directive 31/2010 — buildings that account to the top 15% (based on an estimate) of the national or regional building stock expressed as operatio nal Primary Energy Demand (PED).

Further technical details on the screening approach and the criteria can be found in chapter E1 -4. In addition, the above -mentioned decarbonisation levers contributing to the achievement of the target are explained in chapter E1 -3. The Sustainable Finance Guideline provides the framework for classifying sustainable financings for the achievement of the portfolio decarbonisation target, to attaining 15% sustainable mortgages by 2027 and to the goal of reaching 25% sustainable corporate financ-ing by 2026. Through this, Erste Group continues to maintain its strong role in sustainable financings (see SMB -1 for more details on strategic priorities). Scope The methodology set out in the SFG applies to all credit institutions of Erste Group. The Sustainable Financing KPI only appl ies to business lines of parent banks in the core markets of Erste Group for corporate and retail. Erste Group’s Sustainable Financing KPI is an internal remuneration- linked metric and must not be confused with the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) KPI under the EU Taxonomy. An ongoing dialog ue is conducted with relevant stakeholders such as supervisory and regulatory authorities, investors, analysts and rating agencies as well as academic and environmental institutions and NGOs. Inputs from these stakeholders were received thr ough bilateral tal ks, conferences and supervisory dialogues regarding climate change and consequently used in Erste Group’s policy -setting process.

    "text": "172 GROUP RESPONSIBLE FINANCING POLICY Policy objectives to addres s impacts, risks and opportunities The Group Responsible Financing Policy sets out exclusion criteria for specified economic activities that have harmful socio -envi- ronmental effects. Besides the topic of biodiversity, one main area of concern of the policy is the energy sector. The object ive is to implement principles for the energy sector for better management of environmental and climate risks, as well as energy securi ty and social impacts of the en ergy transition. The alignment of the financed portfolio with Paris Climate Targets is a key priority for Erste Group. Thus, the policy contributes to the achievement of the portfolio decarbonisation targets by 2050. To reach t his target, Erste Group has implemented a well -defined structure and governance framework for the execution of decisions under the Group Responsible Financing Policy. The key decarbonisation lever contributing to achieving the policy’s target is ‘emission reduction in the energy sector’ (see chapter E1 -3 for more details). Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are available in chapter E1 -6. Methodology The policy mandates a two -tier review process. To comply with the requirements of the policy, the deal originator must: — seek a dedicated dialogue with high -emitting clients. This typically starts with an industry and client -specific assessment of ESG issues, to identify Sustainable Financing instruments that match the client’s sustainability and funding strategy. — collect relevant information and documents related to the specific deal. — assess the non -financial risks in line with the Group Responsible Financing policy and propose corresponding follow -up measures if necessary. The second review is carried out by the Local and Group Non -financial Risk Manageme nt (NFR) function. They guide the deal originator and associated employees through the specific NFR process required by the deal in question. Erste Group implements principles for the energy sector to advance the management of environmental and climate risks as well as energy security and social impacts of actual energy transition projects. These energy sector principles are based on accepted industry principles and acknowledged by various stakeholders as best practice. These principles are also aligned with Erste Group ’s commit- ment to reduce carbon emissions as Erste Group recogni ses the strategic importance of renewable energy and energy effici ency pro- jects.

GROUP RETAIL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY Policy objectives to addres s imp acts, risks and opportunities Price instability on the energy market due to climate change can result in decreased profitability for companies in energy -intensive sectors as well as liquidity shortage of retail clients. Additionally, Erste Group faces a higher credit risk as climate -related transition events can lead to negative effects on the profitability of business models and the financial stability of debtors. The conse quences for Erste Group are increased risk provisions and conn ected negative impacts on the profit and loss statement and funds. The polic y supports the achievement of the portfolio decarbonisation targets by 2050. Decarbonisation levers primarily contributing are the ‘emission reduction in the energy sector ’ as well as the ‘ promotion of a sustainable real estate sector ’ (see chapter E1 -3 for more details).

    "text": "173 Methodology The policy requires local entities to collect and store sustainability data, which can be obtained through an EPC of the financed object or an alternative method of assessing energy classification. If no energy classification information is received, the wors t category of the available energy performance scale is assumed for the loan decision. The policy includes special lending conditions based on the energy efficiency values of the objects being financed. These conditions acknowledge that objects with low er energy efficiency are more likel y to result in higher future maintenance and investment costs, which could impact the repayment capacity of customers and represent a credit risk. Higher energy efficiency, evidenc ed by an EPC, means a lower carbon footprint for the building. Thus, for retail mortgages, the pricing is linked to energy efficiency of the real estate collateral. The recommended parameters for housing loans are differentiated by EPC levels, with different maximum loan tenors and Debt Service to Income (DSTI) ratios assigned to each energy efficiency category. For customers planning to renovate the financed property, lending parameters that reflect the new energy performance category expected to be achieved post -renovation can be applied at loan origination. The targeted energy performance level post -renovation must be assessed and provided by locally acceptable methods at the time of loan origination. For clients purchasing residential real estate classified with low energy efficiency level, the maximum DSTI must be applied in ac- cordance with the policy requirements. This ensures that potential future cost increases due to higher energy costs or renova tion expenses are considered. Scope The scope of the policy applies to entities in the group’s core markets and their respective subsidiaries that are engaged in lending to private individuals and micro entities (excludes Erste Group Bank AG , Erste Asset Management, Erste Group Immorent GmbH, Intermarket Bank AG and Erste Digital GmbH). The CROs of the local entities are responsible for the implementation of the policy and ensuring that majority -owned subsidiaries also comply with the requirements of this policy. The policy covers the entire end -to- end retail credit cycle, which includes loan granting, portfolio management and collections. It is adopted across geographies in com- pliance with local regulatory requirements. An ongoing dialogue is conducted with relevant stakeholders such as supervisory and regulatory authorities, investors, analys ts and rating agencies as well as academic and environmental institutions and NGOs.

By adhering to this policy, Erste Group also follows the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on loan origination and mon- itoring as well as the EU GDPR and KYC requirements. GROUP REAL ESTATE FINANCING POLICY Policy objectives to address impacts, risks and opportunities Erste Group benefits from the financial opportunities that arise from the financing of and investments into companies that of fer solutions for adapting to climate change and the funding of adaptation solutions in the real estate market (residential and c ommercial real estate). However, Erste Group also encounters an elevated credit risk as climate -related physical risks can lead to a devaluation of collateral and/or to negative effects on the business models and financial stability of debtors. The consequen ces are increased risk provisions and negative impacts on Erste Group’s profit and loss statement and own funds. For this reason, Erste Group’s Real Estate Financing (REF) Policy requires a sustainability assessment for real estate financing projects with exposure of EUR 20 million or above before making a credit decision. In doing so, the policy contributes to the achievement of the portfolio decarbonisation targets by 2050. Principal mechanisms for decarbonisation that are instrumental in attaining the po licy’s objectives include ‘promoting a sustainable real estate sector’ as well as ‘emission reduction in the energy sector’ (see chapter E1 -3 for more details). Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are available in chapter E1 -6. Methodology With regards to the monitoring process, the policy requires an assessment of energy efficiency, physical risk (e.g. flooding, drought etc.) and the CO 2e value of the asset. It requires a Technical Due Diligence report, which includes the following areas: — a technical and functional evaluation of the asset — a verification of the legal authority’s status — a general evaluation of the building specification — a technical and economic evaluation of the building materials — the implemented technology, the overall quality and workmanship — a rough estimation of necessary investments."

It covers the Group Commercial Real Estate segment, all specialised lending income -producing real estat e clients and clients with certain codes in the nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la communauté européenne (NACE) related to the corporates segment or the industry segments of Real Estate or Hotels and Leisure. The policy is applicabl e to all Erste Group entities engaged in such business activities. These entities are required to integrate the policy into their local frameworks. Erste Group Bank AG has a dual role, both overseeing activities within the group and acting as a distinct legal entity offeri ng corporate banking services. For clients or cli ent groups outside of Erste Group’s home markets, group standards are applicable as defined in the country specifics. The policy does not apply to workout clients, as defined in the Group Wo rkout Policy, which focuses on restruc- turing rather than new business generation. For engagements above EUR 40 million, the policy requires legal documentation to be based on international Loan Market Associ a- tion standards, ensuring the possibility of syndication or sub -participation. An ongoing dialog ue is conducted with relevant stakeholders such as supervisory and regulatory authorities, investors, analysts and rating agencies as well as academic and environmental institutions and NGOs.

The policy is only available internally. GROUP CORPORATE LENDING PRINCIPLES Policy objectives to address impacts, risks and opportunities The Group Corporate Lending Principles policy defines group -wide rules and principles for corporate lending to ensure sound credit risk management, responsible banking and standardised client creditworthiness assessments. The policy supports managing risks stemming from energy and climate change mitigation by conducting a comprehensive ESG assessment of large corporate borrowers. Erste Group may face higher credit risk caused by climate -related transition events that can lead to negative effects on the prof itability of business models and the financial stability of debtors. The consequences are increased risk provisions for Erste Group and con- nected to negative impacts to its profit and loss statement and own funds. For example, price instability in the ener gy market due to climate change can result in decreased profitability in companies belonging to high emitting sectors.

Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are avail- able in chapter E1 -6. If clients are exposed to increased sustainability risks, these must be properly assessed with respect to their financial position in the credit application and considered in the final lending decision as well as the rating. For large corporates in certain industries that lack a climate transition plan and do not measure the current emissions, any new transaction including a policy exception mus t be approved by the Credit Committee of Erste Group Bank AG. This ensures that material sustainability matters ar e integrated into the lending process and encourages clients to adopt sustainable practices. Additionally, ESG assessments are updated annually to reflect any changes in the client ’s ESG risks. Methodology The evaluation of the client performance or solvency includes an assessment of its financial metrics and their engagement in miti-gation activities. ESG assessment questionnaires are used during the lending process to evaluat e climate change mitigation risk s and how ESG factors may positive ly (mitigation) or negative ly (risks) impact the financial performance or solvency of the client . Large corporates are required to share their corporate carbon footprint as well as their carbon offsets. In addition, the cl ient’s energy mix and efficiency are analysed. A more sustainable energy mix and higher energy efficiency benefi t the client’s overall performance in the evaluation.

DECARBONISATION LEVER ‘PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE REAL ESTATE SECTOR’ Erste Group aims to reduce its financed emissions by increasing sustainable financing in the real estate sector through two m ain enablers, its Financial Health Commercial Real Estate Tool to track the carbon footprint of commercial real estate portfolios and the Renovation Financing and Energy Efficiency Calculator to assess its client’s home renovation need and energy efficiency. On one hand, the action contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Finance Guideline’s objective in strengthening its role in sustainable financing. On the other hand, the action aligns with Erste Group ’s Real Estate Financing Policy, as the policy requires a sustainability assessment for residential real estate financings projects with exposure of EUR 20 million or above before making a credit decision. Therefore, this decarbonisation lever addresses the impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO) of the se policies as outlined in chapter E1 -2. Successfully motivating clients to take measures to improve the energy performance of the buildings they own, financed by the Group, contributes to reducing financed emissions in absolute terms if higher emission -loans mature. This lever further contributes to the attainment of the 25% sustainable corporate financing target and the 15% sustainable mortgage targ et (see chapter E1 -4 for more details on targets). Enabler 1: Financial Health Commerical Real Estate Tool Erste Group has developed the Financial Health Commercial Real Estate Tool to enhance client engagement, provide greater tran s- parency and improve the overall quality of its portfolio. It is expected that this instrument will have a positive impact on climate change mitigation by enabling the identification and promotion of energy -efficient building practices. By integrating asset -level data on energy performance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the tool allows both the bank and its clients to actively tr ack and manage the carbon footprint of commercial real estate portfolios. The tool raises client awareness and encourages the adoptio n of renewable energy solutions, such as on -site solar power generation or green electricity procurement.

The tool raises client awareness and encourages the adoptio n of renewable energy solutions, such as on -site solar power generation or green electricity procurement. With this initiat ive Erste Group aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions within its commercial real estate holdings. The Financial Health Commercial Real Estate Tool integrates client asset KPIs with benchmark values derived from Erste Group ’s portfolio data, internal policies and GHG thresholds. For instance, Erste Group compares client EPCs among other client assets in the portfolio (EPC values of CRE assets). A pre -defined CO 2e threshold allows Erste Group to identify assets that are desirable in terms of CO 2e emissions and are aligned with its portfolio reduction pathway. The tool enables clients to visuali se their projects, compare them with other portfolio projects and place them within the context of Erste Group ’s commercial real estate decarbonisa- tion pathways. The screening of each client within the portfolio is currently underway across all entities and will continue throughout 2025 . The primary objective is to engage with all relevant commercial real estate clients, utili sing available underlying asset information. As a result, the F inancial Health Commercial Real Estate Tool indirectly contributes to climate change mitigation and GHG reduction by facilitating the identification and promotion of energy -efficient building practices among clients. Enabler 2: Renovation financing and the Energy Efficiency Calculator To support the energy efficiency transition in residential properties, Erste Group provides its retail clients with digital, web -based solutions that simplify the process of assessing their home renovation needs. The renovation calculator tools help clients understand their current property’s energy efficiency and identify potential improvements. By engaging clients through this platform, Er ste Group provides the possibility to get a clear picture of how their home’s energy efficiency can be improved , which actions to take and how to quantify the business case for these improvements. The expected results include increased client engagement via digita l chan- nels, with more homeowners adopting energy -efficient renovation measures.

Where financially viable and credit risk parameters are met, Erste Group is easing the time to cash for customers to receive financing for energy upgrades. This measure supports the implementation and reali sation of the retail credit risk policy, the SFG as well as the sustainable finance framework. It contributes to the achievement of the target ‘sustainable retail mortgages’ as outlined in the table ‘ Sustainable financing – actuals and target s’. Erste Group proactively engages with clients, offering renovation calculation and financing options through various channels. By leveraging the renovation calculator and associated financing solutions, Erste Group supports clients in enhancing the energy effi- ciency of their homes, thereby promoting sustainable housing solutions . The effectiveness of this initiative is monitored by the granted renovation loans. The described decarbonisation lever with its two enablers drives GHG emission reductions as shown in the table ‘Sustainable Fi- nancing – actuals and targets’. Scope of the decarbonisation lever The geographical scope for the decarbonisation lever encompasses all regions of operations. The finalization of implementation re- lates to a medium -term period. Currently in the rollout phase, the Financial Health Commercial Real Estate Tool is being imple- mented across all Erste Group regions, with the screening of all existing stock assets expected to be completed i n the short - to me- dium- term. The tool focuses on downstream value chain and addresses the commercial real estate portfolio of Erste Group. Renov a- tion Financing and the Energy Efficiency Calculator applies to the downstream value chain of Erste Group, focusing on retail mort-gage clients. The scope covers all regions of operation, particularly targeting clients with high energy intensity. Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are available in chapter E1 -6. DECARBONISATION LEVER ‘FINANCED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR’ Erste Group aims to reduce its financed emissions in the energy sector by increasing sustainable financing for renewable ener gy projects and by reducing its loan portfolio in the coal sector. The contribution to decarbonisation targets significantly dep ends on the nature of the financed company. For instance, a coal -reliant company that utili ses the financing to implement adaptation solutions (e.g. such as wind parks) can thereby reduce its reliance on fossil -based technology. This lever contributes to the decarbonisation of Erste Group’s energy portfolio and is in line with the Sustainable Finance G uideline which defines sustainable investments that contribute to climate -neutrality as well as the Group Responsible Financing Pol icy which sets exclusion criteria for harmful socio -environmental economic activities, such as investments into carbon -intensive energy activi- ties. Additionally, it contributes to the objectives of the Group Corporate Lending Principles. Therefore, this decarbonisation lever addresses the IROs of these policies as outlined in chapter E1 -2.

The achievement of t he policies’ targets is outlined in chapter E1 -4. Through the key actions ‘renewable energy financing’ and ‘reducing coal financings’, investment in and financing of energy -intensive energy companies will be reduced, while financing renewable energy projects enables CO 2e-neutral energy production, which is necessary for the transition to an economic system within the planetary boundaries, offering new clean energy opportunities f or Erste Group ’s portfolio. Key action 1: Renewable energy financing Erste Group ’s renewable energy financing aims to increase the share of sustainable financing for projects that support the transition to cleaner energy sources. By focusing on clients with decarbonisation technologies in regions such as Austria, Czechia, Slov akia and Romania, Erste Group seeks to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy solutions, including wind, solar and battery storage. The anticipated impact includes an increase in financing for renewable energy projects and a reduction in financed e missions from the energy and heat production sectors, particularly if fossil -reliant companies transition to cleaner energy technologies. This initiative is a key measure contributing to the reali sation of the targets and goals outlined in the SFG and the sustainable finance framework policy. Key action 2: Reducing coal financings In line with its Responsible Financing Policy, Erste Group is committed to progressively reduce its financing of thermal coal mining and thermal coal -based power generation, phasing out coal financing by 2030 in alignment with the National Energy and Clima te Plans (NECPs) in its core markets. For the oil and gas sector, Erste Group has committed to avoiding any expansion of financi ng for oil and gas exploration unless it is crucial for independence from Russia and is indispensable for national energy securi ty within Europe. Erste Group actively engages with all clients exposed to thermal coal, focusing on understanding their transition plans. By t he end of 2025, Erste Group aims to analyse all clients in this sector in-depth to assess and align their transition plans with the bank’ s net zero targets.

Relationship managers are equipped with single -client assessment toolkits that use public and internal information to assess each client’s transition readiness and their contribution to Erste Gr oup’s targets. Erste Group ensures that its engagement focuses on helping oil and gas sector clients adopt environmental action plans and decarbonisation strategies. On one hand, this includes avoiding financing for extraction in unconventional sectors, su ch as oil sands or Arctic exploration. On the other hand, Erste Group is prioriti sing engagements of high emitting clients, who are part of their sector’s decarbonisation targets, to assess their transition plans including the necessary CAPEX investments. Through the implementation of the two outlined measures, this initiative will result in a substantial reduction in financed emissions. Renewable energy financing currently constitutes the second -largest component of Erste Bank’ s 25% sustainable financing target. Following commercial REF, it is the most significant contributor to the reduction of financed emissions. The coal exit engage ment strategy is expected to achieve a notable reduction in financed emissions associated with fossil fuels. Focusing on spe cific -purpose financing in renewable technologies, such as wind, solar and hydro, will further reduce Erste Group’s financed emissions and signif- icantly contribute to the 25% corporate sustainable financing target. Additional information on the achieved GHG reductions can be found in table ‘Portfolio Decarbonisation Targets including progress in 2024,’ with particular emphasis on the electricity production sector. Scope of the decarbonisation lever The scope of the ‘Sustainable Financing for renewable energy’ measure covers the downstream value chain of Erste Group, specifi-cally targeting renewable energy projects in the energy and heat production sectors. The geographic scope encompasses all regions of Erste Group, with a primary focus on high -exposure markets such as Austria, Czechia, Slovakia and Romania. The implementation of the Sustainable Financing measure for renewable energy is designed for a long -term period. The scope of the coal portfolio reduction measure applies to the downstream value chain of the bank and covers all entities a nd regions of Erste Group. The time horizon for the reduction of the coal portfolio is medium -term, with in -depth analysis and transition plan assessments scheduled to be completed by 2025 and 2026. With regards to clients belonging to sectors not included in Erste Group’s portfolio decarbonisation targets, Erste Group con ducts similar engagement strategies for clients with high financed emissions. None of the three decarboni sation levers directly address providing remedies for those affected by actual material impacts. The related expenditure for the three decarboni sation levers is not significant for the financial performance of the Group. DECARBONISATION LEVER ‘EMISSION REDUCTION IN OWN OPERATIONS’ Erste Group aims to decarbonise its operations by decarbonising employee mobility through electrification, enhancing building en- ergy efficiency, switching to low -carbon energy sources and increasing employee engagement through trainings and joint action.

T he implemented actions target the bank’s CO 2e emissions from own operations, thus contributing to its net zero operations goal. Erste Group’s actions currently focus on the reduction of scope 1 and 2 emissions as managing operational scope 3 emissions repr esents a significant challenge, as these emissions are largely influenced by the activities of third parties and external stakeholders . Please refer to chapter E1- 4 to gain a deeper understanding of the achieved GHG emission reductions within s cope 1 and 2. Additionally, chapter E1-6 outlines the current CO 2e balance results and those from the previous year. For more insights into energy consumption and its breakdown, please see chapter E1 -5. No significant capital expenditure and operating expenditure is required for the described measures. With regards to the decarboni sation levers affecting the portfolio, no assessments can be made concerning the CO 2e reduction poten- tial yet. Similarly, no projections have yet been made for the CO 2e reduction potential concerning own operations. Scope of the decarbonisation lever The implementation of the measures relates to the short -term period for employee engagement and awareness and to the medium - term period for decarbonisation of employment mobility, increased energy efficiency of own buildings and low carbon energy us e.

This target not only serves as a benchmark for assessing the success of various measures implemented to reduce the carbon footprint of financed projects, but also underscores Erste Group’s commitment to sustainable finance. Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous yea rs, are available in chapter E1 -6. The policies described in chapter E1 -2, such as the SFG, the Group Responsible Financing Policy, the Group Corporate Lending Principles Policy, the Group REF Policy and the Group Retail Credit Risk Management Policy, collectively support the achievem ent of the portfolio decarbonisation target by addressing Erste Group’s material IROs as listed in the table ‘Material Impacts, Risk s and Opportunities’ in chapter SBM -3. The portfolio target is primarily achieved through a reduction in financed emissions in the energy sector as well as the promotion of a sustainable real estate sector. This is explained in more detail in the prior chapter E1 -3. By focusing on both the energy and real estate sectors, Erste Group aims to address major sources of emissions through sustai nable financing, energy efficiency improvements and the transition to renewable energy sources. These efforts are expected to contribute significantly to achieving the GHG emission reduction targets. The portfolio decarbonisation targets address Erste Group’s do wn- stream value chain and applies to all regions in which it operates. Currently, the regions of Serbia, Bosnia and North Macedonia are not included in the mortgage lending and commercial real estate targets . Client executives, industry experts and sustainability advisors were engaged to ensure that Erste Group’s goals are both ambi tious and aligned with broader industry standards and expectations.

Ongoing efforts aim to improve the basis for long- term targets, enabling the definition of specific targets up to 2050 in subsequent years. 2 The base year / actual values are based on available input data (e.g., client sustainability reports), some of them only show CO 2 values as a numerator or tonne cementitious as a denominator. If, instead of the CO 2e intensity per tonne of cement, only the CO 2 intensity per tonne of cementitious was available, this was used. 3 Erste Group’s baseline values fulfill the requirements and calculation approach of third- party standard setters such as SBTi and PACTA. Those standards are based on the latest findings from leading environmental institutions, such as the IPCC. Hence, Erst e Group’s baseline value is to be considered a representative one. 4 The given scopes represent emissions from Erste Group’s downstream activities, in particular the scope 1, 2 and where significant also scope 3 emissions from the financed company / project. 5 At present, the targets for mortgages and commercial real estate do not include the regions of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia.

After defining portfolio decarbonisation targets for priority sectors, Erste Group’s risk appetite evaluation has been enhanc ed through the introduction of an internal indicator. The internal indicator addresses the question at what level of CO 2e emissions or CO 2e emissions per physical metric (identical to the metric used in decarbonisation target setting) in the respective year (e.g., 2024) puts the target achievement for 2030 at risk. Thus, its aim is not only to support the commitment to climate action, but also to enable pro - active steering of portfolio development along the defined decarbonisation path. The internal indicator is set as a buffer above the downward decarbonisation pathway, thus allowing minor deviations above it but still ensuring sufficiently early alert in case of pos- sible misalignment with 2030 targets. In case of a trigger event, the reasons for the indicator breach are analysed and mitigation measures are developed with the involve-ment of relevant stakeholders. This process is dependent on the drivers, industry specifics, impact as well as necessary time for re- mediation. It is discussed and agreed upon with the relevant stakeholders on a case -by-case basis. The progress along the decarbonisation pathway is monitored quarterly via dedicated internal reports presented to the managem ent. Moreover, the actual results are approved by the Management Board as part of the Group Risk Report. The explanation on the progress is elaborated in the chapters dedicated to the decarbonisation of the respective sectors. Electricity sector decarbonisation target The focus within the electricity production portfolio is on diversified electricity producers as well as project -based financing of elec- tricity production.

Moreover, the energy sector will be the central cornerstone of Europe’s decarbonisation success. As one of the most pollutive indus- tries at present, it also offers a substantial opportunity to transform from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Besides, a mor e environ- mentally sustainable energy mix, origination from electricity transformation, will be a key contributor to reduce emissions in other industries. To support the energy transition, the EU climate objectives have helped to increase the ambition of national programmes for d eploy- ing clean energy measures. Electricity systems need to be flexible and require growth in battery energy storage and flexible p eaking power plants such as combined cycle gas turbines. Expansion and modernisation of transmission and distribution grids offer op por- tunities for financing to meet growing electrification demands."

    "text": "180 This portfolio’s scope includes direct emissions (scope 1) from the combustion of fossil fuels and indirect emissions (scope 2) associ- ated with the purchase of electricity, heat and cooling necessary for operations. Emissions related to activities further down the value chain (scope 3) are not included, as they represent a relatively small part of the total emissions in the power generation sector. Erste Group’s methodological approach is grounded in the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) framework, customised for financial institutions. This allows to track and manage the physical emission intensity of electricity produce rs within its portfolio. Decarbonisation targets are defined considering a physical metric and measured as kgCO 2e/MWh. This metric plays a crucial role in evaluating whether Erste Group’s clients are prepared for the necessary transition in line with the 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation objectives. To align with global efforts to limit temperature rise, Erste Group has adopted the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario as the guiding bench- mark. The targets aim for a 49% reduction in the physical emission intensity of the portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2022 baseline of 357.1 kgCO 2e/MWh to 182.7 kgCO 2e/MWh. Erste Group is tracking the progress closely, with interim results showing a reduction of 62% to 136.3 kgCO 2e/MWh by 2024. This status reflects the group -wide focus on energy transformation and finan cing renewable energy projects. Based on the year -end monitoring of the decarbonisation progress of the electricity sector, the actual metric is in line with the internal indicator of 347.2 kgCO 2e/MWh established by Erste Group, thus indicating that the bank’s respective decarbonisation target set for 2030 is not at risk. For deriving the future trajectories for each technology, the NZE 2050 (1.5°C) scenario was used. The IEA, with its ‘Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector’ report, depicts the pathway to building a global energy sector with net zero emission s by 2050. The key d rivers of this scenario are electrification and electricity supply and demand. Electricity supply will change with the share of renewables rising and the use of coal falling globally. Natural gas is used as a transition up to 2030 but will decl ine in the long term. Heat and steam sector decarbonisation target The focus within the heat and steam production portfolio is local, mainly involving district heating units and most of the clients from this sector are in Czechia, Slovakia and Austria and therefore national energy and climate plans in these countries are of im portance. Thus, Erste Group applies a thorough review process to confirm that its activities are centred on heat and steam generation. This portfolio ’s scope includes direct emissions (scope 1) from the combustion of fossil fuels and indirect emission s (scope 2) associated with the purchase of electricity, heat and cooling necessary for operations.

Following the inclusion of savings banks portfolio into the target setting, the targets aim for a 43% reduction in the absolute financed emissions of Erste Group’s portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2022 baseline of 1,614.3 thousand tCO 2e to 924.0 thousand tCO 2e. Erste Group is tracking progress closely, with interim results excluding savings banks portfolio showing a reduction of 58% to 584.7 thousand tCO 2e by 2024. The clients in this sector, being usually a part of the integrated electricity prod ucing companies, have been moving to renewable sources and this transition is visible in the downward movement of financed emissions. Based on the year -end monitoring of the decarbonisation progress of the heat and steam sector, the actual metric is in line with the internal indicator of 1,328.7 thousand tCO 2e established by Erste Group, thus indicating that the bank’s respective decarbonisation target set for 2030 is not at risk. The derivation of the targets follows the absolute contraction approach ( 1.5°C) as foreseen by the SBTi tool and is enhanced with the net zero tool for long -term targets (2050), assuming a 90% reduction of emissions. In this case, the electricity demand for cooling is foreseen to increase in developing economies. According to extremely hot or cold periods, the electrification of heating and cooling will become a challenge for the electricity grid. Oil and gas upstream decarbonisation target The focus within the oil and gas portfolio is exclusively on clients’ upstream activities, thus Erste Group applies a thorough review process to confirm that activities are related to upstream. Decarbonisation of this portfolio includes scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The methodological approach is grounded in the PACTA framework, customi sed for financial institutions. The scenario used is World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2021 NZE aligned (1.5°C ) global. The scenario implies the decline in global oil demand and foresees that natural gas demand remains mostly stable until 2030. The scenario foresees oil demand reduction comi ng from the shift of passenger vehicles, transport cars and heavy trucks to electric power .

Erste Group is tracking progress closely, with interim results that exclude savings banks portfolio of 281.5 thousand tCO 2e by 2024. Based on the year -end monitoring of the decarbonisation progress of oil and gas upstream, the actual metric is in line with the internal indicator of 1,020.4 thousand tCO 2e established by Erste Group, thus indicating that the bank’s respective decarbonisation target set for 2030 is not at risk. The baseline has factored in Erste Group’s business with its energy clients at the point of target setting. Erste Group has c ommitted to refraining from increasing its exposure to o il and gas exploration, with the exemption of projects that align with Europe’s national energy and climate plans (NECPs), as mandated by the European Commission. Iron and steel decarbonisation target Erste Group has defined a net zero target for its clients in iron and steel manufacturing and casting. This portfolio includes scope 1 and 2 emissions. The methodological approach is grounded in the PACTA framework, customised for financial institutions. This allows Erste Grou p to track and manage the physical emission intensity of iron and steel production within the portfolio that is measured as tCO 2e/tonne steel. This metric plays a crucial role in evaluating whether clients are prepared for the necessary transition in line with Erste Group’s 2030 target. To align with global efforts to limit temperature rise, it has adopted the Net Zero 2050 (WEO 2021) scenario as the guiding benchmark. As there is an uncertainty in the development of the technology that is needed to support transition to net zero f or this sector after 2030, the targets are set only for 2030. The scenario assumes a shift on the technolo gy side from basic oxygen furnaces that release large amounts of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide to electric arc furnaces, supported by usage of renewable en ergy. The target is a 24% reduction in the physical emission intensity of Erste Group’s portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2023 baseline of 1.5 tCO 2e/ton ne steel to 1.1 tCO 2e/ton ne steel. Erste Group is tracking the progress closely, with interim results excluding savings banks portfolio showing a reduction of 22% to 1.14 tCO 2e/ton ne steel by 2024.

Automotive decarbonisation target Erste Group has defined a net zero target for the original equipment manufacturers, namely manufacturers of light duty vehicles (LDV). A thorough review process was carried out to identify the clients whose business activities fall under the definition of this sector. This portfol io includes scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, thus enabling the consideration of emissions for the entire lifetime of the vehicle. The methodological approach is grounded in the PACTA framework, customi sed for financial institutions.

A thorough review process was carried out to identify the clients whose activities fall under the definition of this sector and to whom it has a client relationship. This portfolio includes scope 1 and 2 emissions. The methodological approach is grounded in the SBTi framework. Erste Group applies the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA ) for 2030 and the Net Zero Tool for 2050. This allows it to track and manage the physical emission intensity of cement production within Erste Group’s portfolio. It uses a key metric that measures the amount of CO 2e emissions per ton of cement (tCO 2e/tonne ce- ment). This metric plays a crucial role in evaluating whether clients are prepared for the nece ssary transition in line with th e 2030 target s. To align with global efforts to limit temperature rise, it has adopted the Net Zero 2050 (IEA 2021) scenario as the guiding benchmark. There is an uncertainty in the development of the technology needed to support the transition to net zero for this sector after 2030. The target is a 19% reduction in the physical emission intensity of the portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2023 basel ine of 0.584 tCO 2e/ton ne cement to 0.475 tCO 2e/ton ne cement. Erste Group is tracking the progress closely, with interim results, which exclude savings banks portfolio, showing a relatively stable development at 0.591 tCO 2e/ton ne cement by 2024, driven by business developments and positive decarbonisation effects from existing clients. Based on the year -end monitoring of the decarbonis ation progress of cement, the actual metric is in line with the internal indicator (0.594 tCO 2e/ton ne cement) established by Erste Group, thus indicating that the bank’s respective decarbonisation target set for 2030 is not at risk. Erste Group categori ses the portfolio assets based on the current and planned cement -related emission intensities of the clients and, if not disclosed, of related national- wide cement associations to which the client belongs. This classification helps Erste Group to assess cli ents’ readiness for the transition and shaping engagement strategies with them.

To align with global efforts to limit temperature rise, it has adopted the Beyond 2°C Degrees (IEA ETP 2017) scenario as the guiding benchmark. The mortgage targets aim for a 44% reduction in the physical emission intensity of the portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2022 baseline of 48.7 kg CO 2e/m2 to 27.1 kg CO 2e/m2. The portfolio largely consists of volumes in retail business segments. Erste Group is tracking its progress closely, with interim results of 48.8 kg CO 2e/m2 by 2024, indicating a stable development. The stable development in this sector stems mainly from the different business ch aracteristics in comparison with the other segments for which targets are set: — Mortgages cannot be steered on an individual client basis, but systematic and portfolio -based approaches need to be followed. — Mortgages are highly exposed to the macroeconomic circumstances and national programmes in the respective region, such as the availability of Heating & Electricity sources and national renovation campaigns. Systematic approaches need to be taken by the res pective policy makers to be on track for this segment. Considering these characteristics, Erste Group acknowledges its limited possibility to steer this portfolio stand -alone. Currently, based on the year -end monitoring of the decarbonisation progress of mortgages, the actual metric is not in line with the int ernal indicator (46.6 kgCO 2e/m2) established by Erste Group, thus triggering internal governance with corrective measures aiming to effectively mitigate potential risks. One of these measures is a renovation campaign being launched in Erste Group for the y ear 2025. This will help Erste Group’s clients to transition (also supported by digital channels) and as well to reduce their energy costs and improve their property value. The commercial real estate target is a 52% reduction in the physical emission intensity of the portfolio by 2030, bringing it down from a 2022 baseline of 45.9 kgCO 2e/m2 to 22.2kgCO 2e/m2.

In setting these targets, it engaged with key stakeholders, including client executives, industry experts and sustainability advisors, to ensure that goals are both ambitious and aligned with broader industry standards and expectations. NET ZERO OPERATIONS TARGET Erste Group has set a net zero target to reduce its operational scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90 % in comparison to the base year (2017). In absolute figures, the target is to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions from 72.154 to 7.215 tCO 2e by 2030. Detailed CO 2e results for financed emissions, covering both the current and previous years, are available in chapter E1 -6. Additionally, chapter E1 -5 provides more in -depth information on Erste Group’s energy consumption and its composition. The target covers Erste Group Bank AG, Erste Bank Oesterreich and its subsidiaries and CEE subsidiaries in the core markets. The limitation of the scope is due to the limited influence on target setting in the Savings Banks segment. The Net Zero target for operational scope 1 and 2 emissions was set according SBTi´s net zero Standard and Target Setting too l v 1.1, hence there is the compatibility with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The target setting method applied is absolute cont raction, using a cross -sector pathway. It was set in 2021 and its ambition was updated to reflect the further development of the standard and align to best practices. The target covers 100 % of scope 1 and 2 emissions of entities in scope. For scope 2, the market -based method is used to calculate the target. The Net Zero operations target addresses climate change mitigation and energy by aiming to reduce negative impacts through en ergy mix and own GHG emissions. Currently, there is no formal policy covering the operational emission reduction target but an int ernal action plan. The decarbonisation measures necessary, to achieve the operational target, have been identified to be renewable energy transition, energy efficiency improvement, decarbonising employee mobility and employee engagement and awareness traini ngs like explained in chapter E1 -3. An ongoing dialog ue is conducted with relevant stakeholders such as supervisory and regulatory authorities, investors, analysts and rating agencies as well as academic and environmental institutions and NGOs.

In 2024, a 19% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions was achieved compared to the previous reporting year, decreasing fr om 24,411 tCO 2e to 19,799 tCO 2e. This represents a 73% reduction compared to the base year 2017. Specifically, scope 1 emissions de- creased from 25,733 tCO 2e to 13,936 tCO 2e, while scope 2 emissions fell from 46,421 tCO 2e to 5,863 tCO 2e compared to the base year. This significant reduction is primarily due to increased renewable energy consumption. Additionally, the share of electric c ars in the fleet doubled from 11% to 22%.

Erste Group’s focus is therefore category 2 for which its sustainable financings need to comply only with the technical screening criteria for the substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives defined by the EU Taxonomy with following additional simplification for c on- struction and real estate u nder the environmental objective Climate Change Mitigation: Related to climate change mitigation economic activity ‘Construction of new buildings’ For construction of new buildings and the acquisition and ownership of buildings built after 2020, Erste Group requires that the primary energy demand of such buildings must be at least 10% lower than the threshold set for the nearly zero -energy buildings (NZEB) requirements in accordance with current national legislation, in order to be classified as S ustainable Financing. This is cer- tified by an E nergy Performance Certificate. In deviation from the EU Taxonomy, the assessment of buildings larger than 5000 m 2 upon completion , the building resulting from the construction undergoes testing for airtightness and thermal integrity as well as the life -cycle global warming potential (GWP) for each stage in the life cycle is not mandatory. Climate change mitigation economic activity ‘Acquisition and ownership of buildings’ The general methodology for real estate proxies has been provided by management experts. These estimates use reference bench- marks of energy demand by building energy code, year of construction based on applicable technical standards at the time and results in an estimated primary energy demand of a certain type of building in a certain area depending on the available date of cons truction of the building (e.g. building permit, year of construction completion, year of construction from the energy performance certificate). For this purpose, the top 15% existing national building stock are determined by the year of construction respectively major renova- tion, using assumptions and extrapolation, such as a linear distribution between data points available, using the number of building permits per building use and age according to national legislation.

This includes primarily fi nancing of real estate projects and renewable energy, while also supporting Erste Group’s clients in their decarbonisation efforts an d transition to a sustainable state. The Sustainable Finance Guideline and criteria set outlines which financings contribute to the target achieve-ment (see ‘ Methodology ’ in this chapter and E1 -2 for more details). Erste Group aims to achieve a ratio of 25% of sustainable financings towards corporates in its core markets, including Tirole r Spar- kasse and Salzburger Sparkasse, in 2026. Some of the Group's credit institutions not included in this group have set themselv es comparable targets. The target is defined relative to the gross carrying amount of corporate financing on the balance sheet. 15% sustainable mortgages target by 2027 The 15% target for sustainable mortgages tackles Erste Group’s recognised positive impacts and opportunities concerning clima te change mitigation and efficient use of energy. This involves financing and investing in real estate, renovation and energy ef ficiency projects supporting the transition to a sustainable state.

Calculations cover scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions and each was measured in CO 2e. The organisational scope of the calculation refers to all entities in the IFRS scope of consolidation with at least one FTE. To calculate the em issions from activities emission factors with a GWP100 was used including relevant GHG emissio ns (CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF 3). The results are not validated by an external body. In case of the various emission categories, Erste Group implemented the following approaches: Scope 1 and 2 Erste Group uses the UL360 software programme from UL Solutions to gather scope 1 and scope 2 environmental data as stated in chapter E1 -5. For a better understanding of Erste Group’s methodologies and significant assumptions behind the metrics please refer to chapter E1- 5. Scope 2 emissions were calculated by using a location -based and a market -based method. In case of the location - based method, Grid fact ors were used to calculate the emissions. In case of the market -based evaluation approach, Erste Group considered its actual energy composition based on its own procurement strategy. For conversion to GHG equivalents (CO 2e), UL360 uses emission factors fro m DBEIS 2024 (UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and the IEA 2024 (International Energy Agency). In 2024, 24% of Erste Group’s total energy consumption was covered by contractual instruments. The purchased instruments incl ude Energy Attribute Certificates (EECS -GO) for green electricity, covering 39% of the total electricity consumption, and biomass, cover- ing 28% of total district heating consumption from biomass. In 2024, due to the increased use of renewable energy, Erste Group reduced its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 18%, from 31, 854 tCO 2e to 26,015 tCO 2e. 5% of scope 1 data is based on estimates, while the corresponding percentage for scope 2 is 6%. Scope 3 Scope 3 category 1 - Purchased goods and services For scope 3 category 1 a spend -based method was used. Emissions for goods and services were estimated by collecting data on the economic value of goods (spend in EURO) and services purchased by Erste Group and multiplying it by emission factors originat ing from an environmentally extended input -output analysis (EEIOA; exiobase 2024).

Scope 3 category 5 - Waste generated in operations For scope 3 category 5 a waste -type -specific method was used if primary data was available for different waste types in countries. For all primary data available, waste descriptions from Erste Group countries were mapped to waste activities and waste types. Waste types were then matched to waste treatment options based on ‘ GHG reporting by department for business, Energy and Industrial Strategy UK’ (defra 2024). After that, the emissions for the waste types were multiplied by emission factors based on the w aste treat- ment options provided by defra. The waste treatment splits were set based on research and municipal waste treatment data from OECD and European Environment Agency. If a country had no primary data at all, a conservative approach with 100 % municipal waste was assumed. To calculate emissio ns, municipal waste splits per countries as well as defra emission factors were used. Scope 3 category 6 - Business travel For scope 3 category 6 the distance -based method was applied. The distance and mode of business trips are collected in the UL360 system and partially extrapolated when no primary data was available. For the extrapolation country average distance travelle d by mode of transportation based on actual data entered in the system was used. The appropriate emission factors (Umweltbundesamt (UBA), 2023) for each mode of transportation used were applied. Scope 3 category 7 - Employee commuting For scope 3 category 7 a survey was performed among Erste Group employees in selected countries to assess the average distanc e travelled and mode of transportation used by employees to travel to their place of work. The 2024 emission calculation is based o n survey results from 29 entities. In total, approximately 50% of FTEs were surveyed with an average participation rate per ent ity of over 70%. In addition, the number of working days per country, with consideration to vacation days, average sick days and home office rates, was determined.

In the process for preparation and presentation of sustainability information in 2024, Erste Group assessed the ESRS -related require- ments on the reporting on Total GHG emissions, to provide information of the group’s GHG emissions occurring from its upstream value chain. It was identified that ESRS requires Erste Group to consider the emissions for associates/joint ventures which w ere previously not included. After its analysis, it was concluded that emissions from CIT One SRL need to be included in the cal culation. Banca Comercială Română ( BCR ) owns 33% of CIT One SRL in a joint venture arrangement and CIT One SRL is financially consol- idated through equity method by BCR. It is the main supplier of BCR for cash transport and processing services. As the emissions stemming from this joint venture were not included in the Total GHG emissions computation in the previous years a recalculation was performed for 2022 and 202 3 category. The calculation of emissions was done following the same spend based approach as for other scope 3 category 4 emissions. The additional emissions lead to an increase of scope 3 category 4 emissi ons for 2022 by 3,296 tCO 2e and an increase of 3,700 tCO 2e for 2023. For 2024, the emissions total to 3,728 tCO 2e. In 2024 Erste Group’s total operational scope 3 emissions increased due to enhancements in data quality with the biggest increase in emission from employee commuting. The calculation of scope 3 categories 1, 2 and 4 emissions is to 21% based on estimates. For categories 3 and 6 emissions the share of estimates is 6% and for category 5 24%.

An amount of 0,3 million tons biogenic CO 2e-emissions is included in the financed emissions. Overall, the calculation of 2024 financed emissions covers 59.5 % of the credit exposure and increased compared to last year (50.7 %) driven by the inclusion of the exposure to central governments (reported separately from table ‘Financed Emissions’ in tab le ‘Sover- eign emissions’). The remaining uncovered exposure originates from the fact that selected portfolios (e.g., exposure to centr al banks and credit institutions, off -balance sheet items and consumer loans) are not part of the current financed emissio n calculation.

As this standard is in conformity with the internationally recognised GHG Protocol (Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Ac- counting and Reporting Standard) emissions are calculated for all the seven GHGs that are listed in the Kyoto Protocol. These are carbon dioxide ( CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and the fluorinated gases (F -gases): hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluoro- carbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3). For details of the methodology including assumptions see the ‘Methodology’ section below. Erste Group includes the following PCAF -defined asset classes in its calculation: corporate bonds, business loans, project finance, commercial real estate finance an d mortgages. Additionally, Erste Group calculates emissions of the PCAF -defined asset class ‘sovereign debt’ and reports them in a separate table. The leasing business (category 13 ‘Downstream Leased Assets’) is included in Erste Group scope 3 emissions. Th is category is calculated using the same methodology as for category 15 and is separately shown as a sub -item. Erste Group reports for the first time the metric Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI), which sets the client emissions i n relation to client revenues, weighted by the share of the respective client in the total portfolio.

For the real estate object related financed emission calculation the metric is not meaningful, as the calculation is dependent on the financed object and not the client e missions. The portfolio WACI stands at 585 gCO 2e/EUR revenue driven by scope 3 (417 gCO 2e/EUR), mainly by the Energy Industry. One out of the seven currently existing PCAF calculation methodologies – motor vehicle loans – have not been applied yet. The motor vehicles asset class has not been implemented as such because of the low weight of this portfolio. The financed emissions of this portfolio are currently calculated by means of the methodology used for business loans. Methodology Business Loan, Corporate Bonds and Project Finance In the case of business loans, Erste Group follows the PCAF methodology by relying either on emissions reported by the corpor ate customers or emission factors drawn from the PCAF database or on its own approach for loans to large real estate managing com pa- nies. The loans granted to large real estate management companies (NACE L68) are included in the PCAF business loans asset cl ass if the finance purpose cannot be unambiguously assigned to one or more commercial real estate properties. As the PCAF databas e shows only very low emission intensity figures for these exposures, it replaced them with the higher emission intensities of the commercial real estate asset class. In doing so, it proceeded on the conservative assumption that a large part of the funds granted to real estate management companies will de facto be used to finance the relevant buildings, even if the loan agreements as such contain no evidence thereof. Erste Group is working on improving the assignment of deals to the respective PCAF asset classes and expect that specific deals (e.g., allocated in NACE L68) currently calculated as Business Loan, will move to Commercial Real Estate asset class to ensure consistency with internal segmentation. Erste Group is deviating from PCAF standard for listed companies in the business loan and corporate bond modules. It applies the balance sheet value instead of the Enterprise Value including Cash (EVIC) as a denominator to calculate the attribution facto r, as using EVIC might lead to higher volatilities only driven by capital market movements, e.g., in a market stress si tuation"

The use of EVIC in the financed emission calculation is not applied by all financial institutions due to the limitation of the me tric. The topic was recogni sed by PCAF, which published a discussion paper on that topic in December 2024."

    "text": "190 In case of project finance, Erste Group assumes that renewable energy projects (wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower) have an emission factor for scope 1 and 2 of zero. In the absence of a financing purpose and with other project finance it follows the c alculation methodology for the business loans asset class by using either the emissions reported by the businesses or estimates based on financial metrics and emission factors drawn from the PCAF database. Erste Group keeps using the base year 2015 PCAF emission factors (Exiobase database) for the 2024 reporting to ensure compara bility with the figures of the previous year, which were also used as a basis for target setting. The initial PCAF version is based on Exiobase 2015 data base and was the most up -to-date version until March 2023, being replaced by Exiobase 2019 data base. Keeping for 2024 the Exiobase 2015 data base is also in line with the user briefing published by PCAF, providing as a recommendatio n to apply the same economic emission factor dataset for longer periods of time (minimum 3 years). For scope 3 PCAF Emission factors are not containing Downstream Emissions. Methodology Commercial Real Estate and Mortgages With regards to commercial real estate and mortgages, the calculation of financed emissions is based on building data, which in a first step is used to calculate the emissions of a building. Depending on data availability, Erste Group calculates emissions from buildings in the following order (which does not reflect the data quality score): 1. CO 2e emissions as per energy performance certificate 2. primary energy demand (PED) as per energy performance certificate 3. PED class as per energy performance certificate 4. PED class with advanced EPC proxy estimation approach 5. PED class based on the year of construction 6. PED class based on the national average drawn from the PCAF database for buildings in Europe as of 2022 For the Austrian Residential Real Estate buildings and Czech portfolio, Erste Group enhanced the real estate based financed emis- sions calculation methodology by the EPC proxy estimation approach. This approach applies advanced methodologies (e.g., machi ne- learning algorithm) to derive EPC labels from known collateral data fields or other relevant information. Erste Group conside rs expanding this approach to other countries. For calculation 3 to 6, average primary energy demand is based on the primary energy demand class recorded in the PCAF databa se of buildings in Europe as of 2022 to ensure comparability with the previous year’s figures, which were likewise used as the b asis for setting targets in the priority sectors. Once primary energy demand has been determined it has to be converted into emissions as input for calculation 2 to 6. Erste Group decided to use emission conversion factors based on statistical data on energy mixes and emission intensities. Th ese factors are also a key component in the development of scenarios for the future in the decarbonisation model. In addition, co nversion factors obtained in this manner"

Detailed results by PCAF asset class Corporate bonds Corporate bonds with a volume of EUR 2.3 billion account for 1.2 million tCO 2e in financed emissions and an emission intensity of 522 tCO 2e/ EUR million. Business loans Business loans in the amount of EUR 80.6 billion are a major source of financed emissions, because of both their absolute amo unt (36.3 million tCO 2e) and financed emission intensity (450 tCO 2e/EUR million). Business loans comprise financing granted to large international and national corporates, small and medium -sized enterprises as well as micro entrepreneurs (non -financial corporates)."

    "text": "192 Project finance The project finance portfolio had a moderate exposure of EUR 3.2 billion and 1.0million tCO 2e of financed emissions and an emission intensity of 303 gCO 2e/EUR. Commercial real estate Commercial real estate accounted for an exposure of EUR 29.6 billion, with emissions of 0.6 million tCO 2e and a financed emission intensity of 20 tCO 2e/EUR million. Mortgages Retail mortgages with an exposure of EUR 74.8 billion were the second largest contributor of absolute emissions with 3.2 mill ion tCO 2e, but had a low financed emission intensity of 43 tCO 2e/EUR million. Detailed results by sector Erste Group used its in -house customer segmentation by sectors for the purpose of PCAF measuring and disclosure of financed emissions. The aggregated level of financed emissions had a positive impact on Erste Group’s emission intensity as well as the fa- vourable balance between the low financed emission intensity of real estate and the marginal share of the high- emission heavy industry and energy sectors. The sector posting the highest financed emission intensity for scope 1 and 2 of 404 tCO 2e/EUR million, was the energy sector, with a credit exposure covered in the emission calculation of EUR 7.7 billion. The sector posting the highest financed emission intensity (scope 1, 2 and 3), of 948 tCO 2e/EUR million, was the energy industry, with a credit exposure covered in the emission calculation of EUR 7.7billion. Detailed results by country Financed emissions are broken down by country rather than based on the entity in which the exposure was posted. Because of its business model, the country with the highest absolute level of financed emissions (13.2 million tCO 2e) is Austria, which at the same time has the lowest level of emission intensity at 143 gCO 2e/EUR. The country with the highest emission intensity is Singapore at 3 748 gCO 2e/EUR, with absolute emissions coming to 0.74 million tCO 2e. Detailed results by data quality Erste Group relies on the PCAF methodology for scoring data quality (data availability), where the scale ranges from a score of DQ 1 (= highest data quality) to DQ 5 (= lowest data quality). The data quality of the calculations reflects the high dependence o n sectoral emission factors, as relevant customer information was not widely available. Reported emissions in the corporate customers se gment are currently not distinguished between verified and non -verified and therefore the DQ 2 is applied, following a conservative ap- proach. The weighted average data quality of the quantified portfolio was 3.8 as of 2024 reporting and thus improved versus the previ ous year (2023: 3.9). The table shows a breakdown of financed emissions distinguished by data availability (energy performance certificates for the real estate sector and reported emissions for the other PCAF asset classes). Erste Group is disclosing financed emissions from clients reported emissions or derived from an available energy performance cer-tificate separately from financed emissions where it used PCAF factors to calculate financed emissions.

The exposure share is higher for the real estate sector, even though it must be noted that the energy performance certificate – depending on country -specific standards – often covers only the (primary) energy demand and not the level of emissions. For corporate segments, the emission intensity (tCO 2e/EUR million) is lower where Erste Group uses PCAF factors to calculate emissions. For scope 3 this is mainly driven by the fact that PCAF emission factors only contain upstream emissions. Also, th e scope 1 and 2 emission intensity for corporate clients are higher in the reported emissions segment. One of the drivers can be unequal industry distribution as clients in carbon intensive sector are more likely subject of emission disclosure requirements."

The decision to report them separately from other financed emissions is driven by the fact that sovereign scope 1 emissions include the whole production of a country, thus leading to double counting of financed emissions. Ad- ditionally, it is important to note that sovereign emissions will decarbonise automatically when the respective country is decarbon is- ing.

LULUCF Restatement Erste Group is restating financed emissions of the base year and the previous year in case: — a significant methodological change leads to a deviation of +/- 5 % of financed emissions in the reporting year vs. base year — a detected error leads to a deviation of +/- 5 % of financed emissions in the reporting year vs. base year To fulfill the PCAF reporting requirements for the reporting year 2024, scope 3 emissions for all industries calculated in the PCAF asset classes business loans, corporate bonds and project finance need to be included in the financed emissions calculation, which leads to a limited comparability with the previous reporting year and the base year. Additionally, for the ‘automotive indust ry’ the data quality of the emission metrices improved significantly between 2022 and 2023 driven by improved data quality. Compared to the base year, the emission intensity increased from 179 tCO 2e/EUR million to 222 tCO 2e/EUR million in 2024, which is driven by the increase in scope 3 emission intensity. Considering the covered Exposure (in 2022 178.32 EUR billion) the sc ope 1 & 2 emission intensity was 80 tCO 2e/EUR million in 2022 and decreased to 76 tCO 2e/EUR million in 2024."

    "text": "195 Biodiversity and ecosystems This section focuses on Erste Group’s impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Biodiversity or biological diversity can be understood as the variety of life and refers to the uniqueness of all living things (Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, E nergy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology). Biodiversity loss can lead to the extinction of species and the depletion of genetic variations. This can have a far -reaching impact on the food chain and the dynamics of ecosystems, on which humanity thrives. Erste Group is committed to assess and disclose its biodiversity -related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities. Erste Group recognises the indirect impact its investments can have on biodiversity through the identified subtopic soil sealing. E4 SBM -3 – MATERIAL IMPACT RELATED TO BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS Sustainability matter Type of IRO IRO description Value chain Time horizon E4-Soil sealing Potential negative impact Financing real estate and public infrastructure projects can have a negative impact on biodiversity as soil is sealed and land is degraded thus causing increased flooding risks climate change exacerbation and possible health issues caused by decreased air and water quality Portfolio All time horizons SOIL SEALING The EU Soil Strategy for 2030 emphasises that soil sealing is highly relevant for Europe and the region Erste Group is active in. Soil sealing has substantial negative impacts on the environment and society, including the loss of essential ecosystem servic es, increased flood risks, and more intense urban heat island effects. Additionally, soil sealing can contribute to water scarcity, as seal ed surfaces prevent the natural infiltration of water into the ground. The relationship between biodiversity and financial institutions is indirect. Erste Group finances companies that are at least partly dependent on ecosystem services to produce goods and services. Soil sealing has been identified in the 2024 double materia lity as- sessment (DMA) as a negative impact on biodiversity originating from Erste Group’s portfolio activities, in particular the fi nancing of real estate projects and public infrastructure that seal land. Soil sealing contributes to increased flooding risk, exacerbates climate change, and can lead to potential health issues due to reduced air and water quality. Real estate accounts for the largest share of Erste Group’s portfolio activities. Further information can be found in the Con solidated Financial Statements in Note 35 Credit risk exposure under the sections ‘Credit Risk Exposure by Industry and Risk Catego ry’ and ‘Credit Risk Exposure Collateralised’. Erste Group has no material sites (in form of office and branch locations) located in or near biodiversity -sensitive areas and no material impacts were identified related to its own operations affecting any biodiversity -sensitive areas. E4-1 – RESILIENCE OF ERSTE GROUP ’S STR ATEGY AND BUSINESS M ODEL IN RELATION TO SOIL SEALING ERSTE GROUP’S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Erste Group has analysed the business environment it is operating in and performed an analysis to assess the resilience of Er ste Group’s business model.

The evaluation for the resilience analysis was carried out in a holistic and qualitative manner and included in the assessment process. RESULTS OF THE RESILIENCE ANALYSIS The primary goal of the resilience analysis was to illustrate how the business model of Erste Group could be influenced by va rious climate and environmental risk factors. Erste Group did not identify any significant threats to its business model or strateg y when considering biodiversity and ecosystems -related physical, transition or systemic risks. Further details regarding the resilience analysis can be found in chapter E1 SBM -3. STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL Erste Group is assessing its strategy and business model in the light of the analysis described above. Erste Group actively e ngages with clients and takes environmental policies into account when deciding on new business. As an example, in the course of th e valuation of the collateral and inspection of a property, it must be examined in terms of biodiversity. For this purpose, the Green Building Certificate can be checked for information on biodiversity as the first source of information. The biodiversity r elated infor- mation has to be documented in the valuation report. If violations of environmental protection are identified, the necessary renatur-ation costs must be taken into account in the valuation. E4-2 – POLICIES RELATED TO SOIL SEALING Erste Group did not yet develop a comprehensive policy to address this sustainability matter. As a first immediate step, its internal Group Responsible Financing Policy has been complemented by restrictions to finance activities or construction projects that may impact protected sites. Once having established a methodology to estimate or measure the actual contribution to soil sealing from its financed portfolio, Erste Group is dedicated to develop a strategy, establish more actions and set targets to reduc e negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from soil sealing. Material dependencies, physical and transition risks and opportunities are currently not covered. GROUP RESPONSIBLE FINANCING POLICY The Group Responsible Financing Policy establishes the principles for financing of the Energy, Defence/Weapons, Biodiversity and Gaming sector. In the DMA, Erste Group has identified a material impact related to its financed portfolio for the subtopic so il sealing. As a result, Erste Group has broadened the scope of this policy and implemented exclusion criteria regarding activities and c onstruc- tion projects in protected areas as a first step to reduce the identified negative impact. Erste Group will not fi nance any activities or projects located in or having a material impact on protected areas. An impact assessment of the project must be carried out t o assess all potential impacts. If the impact assessment confirms that satisfactory mitigation measures hav e been taken to compensate for any negative impacts of the project on the protected area, the project may be financed.

This policy supports the steering of the portfolio and contributes to addressing the identified material impact. Erste Group has established a clear structure and governance for executing decisions within the scope of the Group Responsibl e Financing Policy and has implemented both a first (carried out by the business function) and second (carried out by the non -financial risk management function) line of defence. The Group Responsible Financing Policy has been communicated to employees and is owned by the Group ESG Office and is available to external stakeholders online on Erste Group’s website. The principles descr ibed in this policy are reviewed at least annually, however, more frequent updates are made whenever Erste Group deems it necessar y. As explained above, Erste Group has expanded the scope of its Group Responsible Financing Policy in 2024 and introduced exclusion criteria regarding activities and construction projects in protected areas as an initial measure to mitigate the identified n egative im- pact. These criteria apply throughout all financial institutions of Erste Group and to all loans to customers where the financed ac tivity constitutes more than 5% of the customer ( Erste Group )’s turnover, with the exception of retail business line products, single payment transactions, transactions below a threshold of EUR 1 million within an existing approved limit. At present, the Erste Group’s Responsible Financing Policy does not take into account any third -party standards or initiatives."

Overall, Erste Group’s focus on promoting a healthy work environment is integral to its business strategy. It believes that ensuring timely health support for its employees leads to improved health and satisfaction. By providing its employees with company health centers in Austria and Czechia, Erste Group endeavors to create a healthy work environment . Erste Group’s saving banks in Austria and local banks in the countries prioriti se the health and safety of its employees by implementing comprehensive health and safety strategies that go beyond legal requirements. These strategies offer preventive health checks and medical e xamina- tion measures, private health insurance, private medical services, accident i nsurance, psychological support for mental health care, and access to wellness program mes and activities. These actions demonstrate the strong commitment to ensuring timely access to medical support and prevention. For more details, please refer to chapter S1 -4. Actions and coordination happen locally, as the legal frameworks and possibilitie s vary based on the country of operation. Local entities are in contact with Erste Group’s health center in Vienna to exchange information and best practice s. Gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value Erste Group fosters initiatives for fair and equal pay for its employees , regardless of their gender. There has been a negative impact of gender pay gap identified related to own employees, which is systemic with in the context of job structure and prevalence of certain gender in certain job roles but also individual based salary negotiations beyond collective agreement in the hiring process. This ne- cessitates Erste Group to strive for a reduction of the adjusted as well as the unadjusted gender pay gap of its employees. First steps towards transparency of gender pay gap reporting were done in 2023 by establishing a group -wide common approach, definition and external certification. Actions and targets are focused on the job structural aspects of gender pay gap, to balance representation of women and men in various job roles especially in top -management. For more information about the methodology and measurements please refer to chapter S1 -4, and chapter S1 -16 for actions. Training and skills development Erste Group’s growth focus is centered on providing its employees with the best possible support in their ongoing development .

The strategy is organised around three key priorities: empowerment, growth , and attractiveness. As part of Erste Group’s empowerment approach, Erste Group gives its employees a voice through regular group -wide engagement surveys , which are described in S1 -2 in more detail. Based on this continuous feedback from its employees, Erste Group supports targeted improvement measures in all areas and constantly grows with its employees. The growth focus is centered on providing Erste Group’s employees with the best possible support in their ongoing development. Erste Group is committed to strategic workforce planning to enable more targeted r ecruitment and further development measures as well as flexible skills development. Talent promotion is based on g roup -wide defined leadership dimensions and, as part of a structured succession planning process for senior management, Erste Group’s managers of tomorrow will be developed on this basis, thus ensuring seamless management transitions in the future. Erste Group stands for a work culture that fosters a sense of belonging and values the work of its employees. Therefore, with the attractiveness pillar of Erste Group’s People & Culture strategy, Erste Group focuses on ensuring the financial health of its employees and further establishing a successful employer brand. Measures include a commitment to greater transparency and gender equali ty in remuneration as well as the continuous improvement of the financial literacy of Erste Group’s employees. Erste Grou p’s principles of employee centricity drive its operations, enabling Erste Group to reali se the potential of its employees. Furthermore, Erste Group is committed to nurturing an inclusive work environment for all employees, including monitoring progress towards targets in collab-oration with its local bank subsidiaries to reach underrepresented gender ratio metrics on managerial levels. Human rights commitments Erste Group’s Code of Conduct, which aligns with international standards and conventions, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and also prohibits involvement in human trafficking, forced labor, or child labor was updated and inter- nally published in December 2024. The principles which are included in the Code of C onduct derive from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Guiding Principles o n Business and Human Rights, amongst others.

This can have significant negative impacts on women’s economic security. Erste Group pre- vents and mitigates discrimination once detected in accordance with group diversity policy and local antidiscrimination proce sses described in chapter ‘S1 -3 – Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for own workforce to raise concerns’. These policies ensure compliance with legal requirements and international standards, promoting a positive and supportive work environment. WORK -LIFE BALANCE Work -life balance is steered under a common umbrella within the Erste Group, without a specific group policy in place, to respect local cultural specifics and local legislation. Regardless of location and hours worked, Erste Group strives to create an env ironment that promotes collaboration, productivity, efficiency, trust, safety, and health. To achieve this, Erste Group encourages employees to actively use the opportunities provided by its local entities to balance their private and professional goals, develop healthy self -man- agement skills and prioriti se their work effectively. Although measures used can differ for each entity based on legal framework and cultural habits, Erste Group’s overarching objective in the group is to provide options for work -life balance for all its employees and encourage them to actively manage their choices with an emphasis on effective collaboration, productivity, efficiency as well as their personal and business goals. HEALTH AND SAFETY The topic of Health and Safety is steered under a common umbrella within Erste Group, without a specific group policy in place, to respect local cultural specifics and local legislation. Erste Group aims to create a positive impact on employees by focusing on their physical and mental health.

Additionally, many entities provide access to mental health platforms, where employees have access to psychological and emotional support b y industry professionals as we ll as sports initiatives and work -life balance options. GENDER EQUALITY AND EQUAL PAY FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE Employees should feel rewarded fairly, according to the relative value of their jobs within Erste Group. Employees engaged in similar jobs in different parts of the company should be rewarded equally. Erste Group strives to reward employees competitively compared to those who are engaged in similar jobs in other organi sations of the respective market and/or sector. Having a compensation struc- ture based on a competitive base pay is key. All employees are entitled to fair and favorable working conditions with special focus on remuneration. Remuneration policies and practices shall be gender neutral. ‘Gender neutral remuneration policy’ means a remun er- ation policy based on equal pay for women and men for equal work or work of equal value. Erste Group observes that unadjusted gender pay gap is, among other, also attributed to the uneven distribution of men and wo men in better paid positions, with men dominating higher -remuneration type of positions or leadership roles. Through collective bar gain- ing agreements and internal job grading, Erste Group fosters equality within job roles. To mitigate this negative effect, Ers te Group introduces targets for the underrepresented gender, women in top management position s and fair succession planning (see chapter S1-5). These are addressed in the Group Remuneration Policy. Group Remuneration Policy Erste Group’s Remuneration Policy promotes gender equality and ensures equal pay for equal work, thereby creating a secure en vi- ronment with standardi sed and adequate wages. It supports equal professional development opportunities and addresses the gender pay gap. Most subsidiaries operate under collective bargaining agreements, ensuring wage security. By fostering gender equali ty, Erste Group enhances professional development and mental well- being for its employees. Erste Group’s Remuneration Policy aims to attract and retain competent and committed employees who perform their roles in the long -term interests of Erste Group, its customers and shareholders. It establishes the standards, rules and principles of the remu ner- ation system and strategy, which are designed to reward competitively , based on long -term sustainable performance. The policy de- fines the remuneration system, including pay components, variable remuneration schemes, performance processes, job structures , salary benchmarking and both monetary and non -monetary rewards, all of which are linked to Erste Group’s values and respective company strategies. The remuneration committee of Erste Group Bank AG’s Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the remuneration policy to ensure it operates as intended. The committee functions under delegated authority from the supervisory func tion. The remuneration committee of Erste Group Bank AG approves the general principles of the remuneration policy, reviews them at least once a year and is responsible for their implementation."

Group Suitability and Succession Policy The Group Suitability and Succession Policy outlines the process for assessing the suitability of individuals who are members of the Management and Supervisory Board and Key Function Holders. This policy provides a structured framework for defining a diver se succession list of potential candidates for these boards, while also monitoring and considering the gender balance targets as specified in the Diversity and Inclusion Policy. The Management Board, in collaboration with the local Human Resources department, evalu-ates respective managers based on performance and potential, using specified criteria outlined in the policy. The results of all assess-ments form the basis for a pre -selection of potential successors and are discussed in upcoming succession talks. Group People & Culture is responsible for developing and constantly reviewing the succession process. It also initiates the a nnual succession process and provides instructions and documentation templates to local Human Resources departments.

Believe in yourself (#glaubandich) as you are and follow your own path – Erste Group tries to live this attitude towards its customers and employees every day. For Erste Group, an inclusive corporate culture means recogni sing every employee for their individuality. Erste Group understand s diversity and inclusion as a mindset that obliges everyone to treat each other with respect, so that everyone feels safe to speak their mind openly. Erste Group seeks to create an environment in whi ch people are enabled to develop themselves, support each other when facing challenges and bring out the absolute best in themselves and their peers.

Novi Sad (Erste Bank Serbia)), with the respective entities responsible for their local subsidiaries.

It refers to Erste Group’s Code of Conduct, which aligns with third -party standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. S1-2 – PROCESSES FOR ENGAGING WITH OWN WORKFORCE AND WORKERS’ REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT IMPACTS As a responsible employer, Erste Group recogni ses the importance of engaging with its workforce and workers’ representatives to understand the impacts of its operations on its employees. One approach that Erste Group takes to foster positive impacts and miti- gate negative impacts is by promoting a feedb ack culture. The company supports this culture by providing many channels for direct and indirect engagement with employees, managers, teams and communities. This gives employees ample opportunities to voice their views and concerns and provide feedback on matters of work -life balance, health and safety, training and skills development, diversity and equality and any other topic. The Management Board, particularly the CEO, is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the organi sation in a manner that serves the best interests of the company, while considering the interests and concerns of the employees. DIRECT ENGAGEMENT Erste Group engages with its employees directly through annual one -to-one performance reviews, through the Group internal social network, via the Group engagement survey, or indirectly via representative bodies such as works councils. Employee engagement activities take place at both the organi sational level and lower ones such as team, project, or community level. Performance reviews Talent management at Erste Group is driven by constructive feedback and a fair and transparent assessment of individual poten tial. The individual performance review meeting takes place annually between the direct superior and the employee. During the perfo r- mance review, the contribution and impact the employee has made to the company’s success and employee’s personal development plan are discussed. The department management (B -1), as the most senior role, is required to consider the results of these discussions and have an overview of performance and impact in their area of responsibility. Additionally, assessments of long -term performance and potential of individuals can be made during talent reviews / succession planning sessions throughout the year. Group -wide internal social n etwork In 2024, Erste Group’s internal social network was successfully launched for all employees.

This tool is an interactive and easy -to-use communication channel, which fosters dialogue between employees. It increases visibility and interaction across country and entity borders and establishes a unique and shared employee experience. Additionally, this tool is useful for top management to share and discuss current topics, initiatives, and events with all employees. For example, the CEO of Erste Group connects directly with employees through the pl atform in ‘ Ask Me Anything ’ chat sessions. Overall, Erste Group’s internal social network is very well received by employees. As of the end of December 2024, there are already 14 active g roup -wide communities in which employees exchange knowledge about ESG, Artificial Intelligence, Tech trends, etc . or get together to support each other e.g. Queer and Allies community, ErsteColours community, Ability and Inclusion, community Women’s Talk, Gen Z Community. Furthermore, there are 270 country - and institute specific communities in place. Group Commu- nications together with the local Communications Departments are responsible to develop the communication platform enhancing employee experience and strengthening its g roup -wide governance. Engagement survey Erste Group aims to improve its workplace culture by actively listening to employees and acting on their feedback. Employee s urveys provide insights into employee engagement, identifying both strengths and areas for growth. Erste Group aims to conduct the survey on a yearly basis. The People & Culture team is responsible for coordinating regular engagement surveys at the g roup level. The employee engagement survey serves as a highly valuable mechanism for receiving feedback from employees which influences decisions directly.

An example is the introduction of the so-called role of ‘ Magic Advisors ’ in some entities to customise actions within their own teams based on the team's feedback in the engagement survey. In 2024, Erste Group conducted an employee engagement survey to measure employee engagement and help make Erste Group the best workplace it can possibly be. More than 40,000 people were invited and more than 32,000 employees participated, achievin g a respo nse rate of 81%. Their ratings and more than 37,000 comments contributed to a group -wide Employee Engagement Index score of 80 out of a possible 100 points. To ensure a positive impact of the survey on the employees, a follow -up process to discuss feedback with employees and plan the next steps was initiated at various levels across the Group. INDIRECT ENGAGEMENT VIA WORKER’S REPRESENTATIVES In accordance with legal requirements, Erste Group involves its employees in management decisions via representative bodies i n matters that directly affect employees. In Erste Group Bank, as required by law, four times a year the works council meets with the Management Board. In addition, People & Culture routinely convene with the works council to hold discussions and keep a steady line of communication. Periodic e -mails from the works council to employees informing about improvements related to employees prove the effectiveness of indirect engage- ment. The main tasks of the works council are: — monitoring adherence to laws relating to employees, payment of salaries, occupational health and safety, — intervening to ensure compliance with employee -related legislation, improving working conditions and setting up/organising in - company training — two-way sharing of information: from the Management Board to the works council and from the works council to the employees, and vice versa — employee counselling and consultations with the employer on current matters The local banks in Erste Group’s core markets (Erste Group Bank AG, Erste Bank Oesterreich, Česká spořitelna, Banca Comercial ă Română, Erste Bank Hungary, Slovenská sporiteľňa, Erste & Steiermärkische Bank (Erste Bank Croatia), and Erste Bank a.d.

When a negative impact is identified, Erste Group takes steps to provide remedies , which may include: — providing access to counseling and support services — implementing corrective actions, such as policy changes or additional training — engagement with employees and their representatives to ensure that the remedies provided are fair and effective To ensure effectiveness, Erste Group monitors the outcomes of its remediation actions through feedback from affected employees and engagement surveys. Approach to remediation of discrimination To remediate cases of discrimination, Erste Group has established specific channels and processes to enable employees to rais e their concerns. Each entity has its defined anti -discrimination approach. Erste Group’s employees can address their concerns rega rding any type of discrimination , including gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value. In Austria, the Anti -Discrimination Officer provides advice and mediates in cases of harassment, discrimination, or bullying. Advice for employees is confidential and accompanied by a structured conflict resolution process , if required. An anonymised report pre- pared by the Anti -Discrimination Officer covers, among other things, the reported cases of discrimination. The report is communi- cated to the Management Board , People & Culture department, and the employees’ council. Awareness -building and prevention measures implemented by the Anti -Discrimination Officer in cooperation with management are instrumental for remediation. The primary focus is on raising awareness and improving processes, behaviour and organisational issues among both management and employees. To support these efforts, unconscious bias training is offered to make employees aware of unconscious prejudices a nd help them act more sensitively. The Anti -Discrimination Officer is also the contact person for all complaints and questions relating to harassment and bullying and plays a key role in ensuring compliance with all human rights. All employees may seek advice in absolute confidentiality and develop measures and resolution strategies in a collective process, the implementation of which is the n supported by the Anti -Discrimination Officer. Measures, remediation processes and consequences are described in the Works Agree- ment on Anti -Discrimination and Respectful Behaviour in the Workplace which is communicated to the employees o n Erste Group’s intranet. Local entities have aligned the anti -discrimination processes with their respective local legal requirements and Erste Group ’s values.

Depending on the entity, employees can file complaints to the Anti -discrimination Committee, Committee of Ethics, the Internal Ombudsman, the Ethics Manager, Head of HR Employee Care Department, or the Head of local u nions, authori sed individuals from Human Resources or Legal or mobbing officers. Channels to raise concerns As already described, Erste Group has established multiple channels through which employees can raise concerns and have their needs addressed by the company: — line manager as the first contact point to raise any concerns — whistleblowing process (see chapter G1 -1) — worker’s representatives, e.g., local works councils — employee survey — performance reviews — contact with the Anti -Discrimination Officer, ethics manager, ombudsman office, or specially trained people Each entity decides on local initiatives to inform employees about the availability of channels to raise their concerns.

Diversity audit This qualitative analysis is a fact -based index model which examines how women ’s careers develop in organi sations and which frame- work conditions are essential for this in the company. The indexing is a valuable indicator of permeability openness and tran sfor- mation capability in companies. The index model enables comparisons across company structures and sectors. The aim is to identify areas for action and develop effective measures accordingly to ensure a common standard. The measures were defined based on the results on group and local level.

While Erste Group does not set measurable targets to track the effectiveness of all policies and actions on the group level, Erste Group has specific targets related to the material matter , gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value. These targets are published in the Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy and foster s equal professional development to ensure equal opportunities for all genders. On group level Erste Group wants to remediate the impact of the gender pay gap by balancing gender distribution in top -management positions (board level and B -1).

Novi Sad (Erste Bank Serbia)) have been defined: Proportion of underrepresented gender in mana ge- ment board and proportion of underrepresented gender in board –1 management. Erste Group sets targets only for diversity matter s because it gives the respective institutions in the group the freedom to decide what the optimal goal is in their local environment for topics such as average training hours, percentage of part -time employment, per- centage of performance evaluation, average sick days, etc. As Erste Group does not have any other targets related to the other sus-tainability matters, it tracks the effectiveness of the policies and actions in relation to material IROs at group l evel via its engagement survey. The overarching goal of Erste Group’s personnel strategy is to ensure a diverse corporate culture that promotes collective contribution and impact beyond gender, geography, entity, or business area borders. The effectiveness of material impacts on Erste Group can be seen through results in the annual engagement survey, which focuses on various critical topics. These include in divid- ual contributions, empowerment, continuous improvement, feedback from management, opportunities for growth, motivation to go the extra mile, the availability of technology resources and intent to continue working for Erste Group in the future.

The group diversity management team in People & Culture department analysed the proportion of women in management in previ- ous years and discussed the necessity of target setting for local banks in core markets listed below. Due to the low number o f B-1 position s and low fluctuation in these positions, it is essential to set the target in the medium term. This and the different starti ng positions in the individual banks resulted in a corresponding target of 33 % for the B -1 level. After alignment with Holding Boa rd, the targets were set and anchored in the Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy. Employees/employee representatives have not been included in setting targets. The group diversity team tracks performance on a quarterly basis and together with local diversity teams analyses reasons in case of deviations. The target encompasses the following local banks in core markets: (Erste Group Bank AG, Erste Bank Oesterreich, Česká spořite lna, Banca Comercială Română, Erste Bank Hungary, Slovenská sporiteľňa, Erste & Steiermärkische Bank (Erste Bank Croatia) and Erst e Bank a.d.

The most recent major update of the diversity targets was carried out in 2023. As baseline values for individual targets per entity in scope, separately for gender representation by b oard mem- bers and B -1, the values of 2022 were considered (28% share of women in top -management ). The current target horizon extends until 2028. The Group Diversity’s proposal for diversity targets in top management was approved by the Holding Board, following an analys is of the current situation at the banks in the core markets. In 2024, no adaptions were made to the targets. Since the targets are set until 2028 (medium -term), there is no need to update them regularly unless a new regulatory change or a change in strategy occurs. The diversity dashboards are updated quarterly and made available to top management on an ongoing basis."

No straight linear progress has been expected as it needs to be considered hand in hand with succession planning for top -management positions. Erste Group believes that the progress of proportion of underrepre- sented gender in Management Board is on the right track and with effective succession planning the goal in 2028 can be reached. Many of the banks already reached the targets of 30% women in Management Board , whereas Erste Bank Hungary, Česká spořitelna, Erste Bank Croatia and Erste Group Bank AG are on their way to reach the goal. Slovenská sporiteľňa needs to catch on in both in Management Board and Board -1 in the following years. When it comes to board -1 positions, some fluctuations from one year to another are acceptable, as a positive trend towards reaching the goal in four years ’ time is anticipated.

In 2024, employee turnover at Erste Group (total of men and women) was 12.2 % (2023: 12.5%). Turnover ratio presents the number of employees who left voluntarily, due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service durin g the fiscal year. The number of leavers does not include employees on parental leave and internal transfers within the group. The employee turnover rate in % is calculated (based on the BDA formula) as follows: the number of employees who left the company during t he reporting period (12 months) is divided by the average headcount (HC) at the beginning of the year. Information about average FTEs can be found in the financial statements Note 8 to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements 2024. Using Full -time Equivalent for financial statements, especially in tracking administrative expenses, is generally more effec tive than headcount as it better represents the cost of labor.

Generally, employees are invited to a personal performance review with their line managers to talk about their performance, to define goals for the current year and define plans for their further personal development once a year.

Erste Group’s approach is to understand the reasons for the gap and bring transparency to what part of the gender pay gap can be explained and foreseen due to job structure and other explanatory factors. Erste Group established a methodology to analy se and monitor the gender pay gap. It aligns on transparent communication and coordinate efforts to mitigate any potential negative impacts on Erste Group’s workforce related to gender pay gap within Erste Group. Erste Group holds a Fair Pay Analyst certification from the Fair Pay Innovation Lab, with its UNIVERSAL FAIR PAY CHECK® rec- ogni sed as a certification trademark by the European Union Intellectual Property Office. This check integrates different European legislative initiatives into a single procedure, accommodating both current and future legislation, making certification poss ible re- gardless of location and applicable laws. The analysis, based on the organi sation’s internal data, lays the groundwork for accurately determining the necessary steps to implement fair pay. Through this certification, Erste Group underscore its commitment to c on- ducting fair pay analyses correctly. In Erste Group, the gender pay gap is viewed from two perspectives: an unadjusted pay gap and adjusted pay gap. The unadjusted gender pay gap shows the percentage difference between the average gross hourly pay for women and men. The adjusted gender pay gap shows the percentage difference between the average gross hourly pay for women and men after accounting for factors that typically influence pay.

It is calculated using a regression analysis, which is a robust mathematical method to determine how each variable affects each employee’s compensation. To support a common methodology over the group, job levelling is used as the mai n objective factor. This factor explains most differences in pay. On top, age, management responsibility and country specific o r even entity specific factors are considered which reflect the local job market. In order to calculate the adjusted pay gap across the Group, the country results were weighted according to the number of employees analy sed. Unadjusted gender pay gap In Erste Group, the gender pay gap for its employees is calculated based on an annualized, full -time equivalent measures, as the average pay of all men and women across the group and all job levels, representing the unadjusted gender pay gap. The consoli dation on group level is done by weighing the individual entity results by their headcounts. This unadjusted gender pay gap calculation for Erste Group’s own employees in 2024 was 28.9%. This covers all own employees in scope where remuneration data was available through payroll systems. Variable remuneration for performance in 2024 is based on the overall performance of the entity and individual performance of each employee. Therefore, most of the variable remuneration will be granted in April 2025. For the 2024 pay gap and remuneration r atio, an estimate of variable remuneration based on 2023 performance (granted in 2024) was necessary to cover total compensation. F or"

Analysis of the g ender pay gap Erste Group conducts a more detailed analyses on a yearly basis, to ensure that men and women with comparable jobs or job respon- sibilities and performing work of similar value are receiving equal pay. In 2023, Erste Group started to analy se the wage data of 27,625 employees across all its core markets and in 2024 it increased the number to 38.195 employees. Within this scope, the analysis revealed an average global gender -specific pay gap of about 26.8% in 2024 (2023: 27.9%), which is greatly influenced by the distribution of functions among male and female staff. Having a gender pay gap does not mean that women are paid less than men for the same job. Therefore, Erste Group also considers acceptable reasons that explain differences in pay, suc h as job, experience, location and performance. Following the analysis of Erste Group employees, the adjusted gender pay gap is 2.5%. The Gender Pay Gap analyses shows that, the unadjusted pay gap is driven by job leveling as it is used as the main objecti ve factor. This factor explains most differences in pay. One of the ways Erste Group addresses this topic is by setting the targets for gender representation in top management. Remuneration ratio Erste Group shows the income distribution within the company by comparing the annual total remuneration of the highest -paid employee with the median total annual remuneration of all employees in its core markets Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Ro- mania, Croatia, Serbia and all other countries in which Erste Group has subsidiaries. All salaries are calculated as annual s alaries on the basis of full -time equivalents. Variable remuneration paid out in 2024 is con sidered. For 3% of the employees, their salaries were interpolated according to the salary distribution of the rest of the workforce . The remuneration ratio for the 2024 fiscal year is 67.5. It is calculated by means of the following formula: annual total remuneration of the highest -paid employee of Erste Group (CEO) divided by the median annual total remuneration of all employees of the organisation except for the highest -paid person. S1-17 – INCIDENTS, COMPLAINTS AND SEVERE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS Erste Group has reported on its approach to complaints, channels to raise them and on remediation of negative impacts in chapters S1-2 and S1 -3. Channels for raising concerns have been identified in each entity and the number of complaints submitted to the company’s reporting tool has been recorded. There have been in total 26 reported incidents of discrimination, including one d iscrim- ination case from 2023 which is still under investigation in Hungary.

As part of these established processes, every employee has the opportunity to have their specific case examined by internal, independent bodies. This ensures that each individual case is followed up accordingly, wi th em- pathy and respect for all parties involved as well as utmost confidentiality. In most cases, a respectful and substantial solution can be found internally. This reflects Erste Group’s commitment to fostering a culture of trust, respect, and equality throughout its organi sation. In 2024, the company received 1 60 total complaints from its workforce regarding various topics, thereof 84 in Czechia relating to unacceptable behavior, discrimination, termination of employment and entitlements and workplace management. There have been no fines, penalties, or compensation for damages resulting from incidents of discrimination and complaints o r relating to severe human rights issues or incidents connected to the company’s own workforce.

Examples of this are identity theft, fraud and financial loss. Such incidents could compromise the security and privacy of customers by exposing their private and financial data. This risk over all time horizons could lead to a loss of trust, damage to Erste Group’s r eputation and legal consequences (e.g., breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))."

S4- 2 – PROCESSES FOR ENGAGING WITH CONSUMERS AND END -USERS ABOUT IMPACTS FINANCIAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL BANKING ( POSITIVE IMPACTS ) Direct engagement with financially vulnerable retail customers occurs through a variety of channels, both online and in the branches where Erste Group offers advisory services to help them achieve their financial goals. To ensure that its customers continue to benefit from Erste Group’s positive impacts, an advisory framewo rk is in place. This framework revolves around encouraging active customer engagement around Erste Group’s advisory propositions, which leads to addressing their drivers of financial heal th. A key method to facilitate this process is through the democratisation of advice across all channels and increased accessibility. Erste Group also has a process in place to determine the effectiveness of these channels of engagement. Following an appointm ent regarding a customer’s financial health, an email is sent to the customer who is free to respond with tailored feedback as well as the chance to respond to a series of standardised questions on the level of their satisfaction towards the process of engagement. Studies are then conducted on the feedback provided that occur on a quarterly basis and further help to inform group strat egy. Erste Group continuously improves accessibility and service quality by collecting and analysing customer feedback from advisory interacti ons. One example of this is the Banking Market Monitor study, surveying 7,000 customers annually, to understand and mee t evolving customer needs . Further research is also undertaken to gain insight into the perspectives of retail customers that may be particularly vulnerable. For example, the social banking impact report specifically targeted feedback from a represent ative sample that included 162 people in financial difficulties . Group retail transformation is the department responsible for ensuring engagement with the Erste Groups retail customers. Erste Group is also a member of multiple national organisations such as the Social Enterprise Network of Austria (SENA) and the Österreichischer Verband gemeinnütiger Bauvereinigungen (GBV) , as well as organisations such as Housing Europe and Euclid. It is through engagement with these organisations that Erste Group can better understand the situation of its retail customers.

The reasons for a data breach can vary, e.g. from an email sent erroneously to the wrong recipient, to a system malfunction. Data breaches can be detected through internal technical or organisational measures (e.g., through the data leak prevention system or through internal reports from empl oyees that became aware of the data breach ) or through external reports (e.g., through a notification from the wrong recipient). All internal and external data breach reports are collected and evaluated per entity . According to Article 33 of the GDPR, a notification will be filed with the responsible data protection authority if the data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Beyond that, the dat a breach is communicated to the affected person, when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedom in accordance with Article 34 of the GDPR. The r elevant risk assessment is su pported by an internally developed data breach risk assessment tool, based on the methodology provided by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity . Developing and refining Erste Group’s incident response plan is a crucial element of its risk mitigation efforts. This includes clear protocols for identifying, reporting, investigating, lessons learned and mitigating any potential negative impact on customers."

In 2024, no such notifications were issued. Erste Group’s Contact Center is the first port of call for instant customer support, playing a crucial role in maintaining strong business relationships. Available 24/7 and reachable by telephone and e -mail, the Contact Center ensures that Erste Group’s cl ients receive timely and effective assistance. Complaints raised by customer base are seen as a crucial in helping to refine and improve upon processes in place. For specific privacy -related matters, contact details are provided online and in the data prot ection notice . Further reinforcing Erste Group’s commitment to transparency and trust in its business interactions, customer complaints can be reported on an anonymised basis via a whistleblowing platform (for more information, see chapter G1-1). In 2024 0.33% of group customer complaints were related to privacy matters . Furthermore, research is conducted into the levels of satisfaction with the customer complaints processes to determine effectiveness as well as their overall levels of usage and knowledge of the channels availa ble. This information is collected in the form of structured online interviews targeted at those who have submitted complaints. Further trust of these processes is facilitated through reporting on an anonymised basis. Any complaints involving Erste Group’s business relation- ships can also be made through Erste Group’s call centre and online, with each complaint being treated as important with the aim to resolve them in the best possible way .

FLiP has played a leading role in the field of financial education in Austria since 2016 and advocates on a socio -political level that financial education should be included in the national curriculum. Furthermore, FLiP played a key role in the development of the National Financial Literacy Strategy. Since April 2023, FLiP has been a non -profit limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Erste Social Finance Holding GmbH, 49% of which is owned by Erste Group and 51% by Erste Foundation. F LiP is considered as a part of Erste Group’s value chain. The importance of a successful financial life for personal life planning is experienced in a fun and interactive way during F LiP tours. Since FLiP opened its doors in October 2016, more than 96,000 visitors from all types of schools and age groups have taken pa rt in the interactive tours offered in Vienna. Supported by Erste Bank Oesterreich and the regional savings banks, FLiP2Go (the mobile version of FLiP ) has attracted more than 44,000 visitors on its tours across all of Austria. The success of the new FLiP app launched in 2024 can be measured using session tracking , with the number of sessions for 2024 exceeding 15,000. The number of downloads of its teaching materials also provides an indication of its reach as well as an alignment with its goal of advancing the fie ld of financial education. This number has gone up continuously since FLiP was first opened and has amounted to a total of 6,900 downloads in 2024. The blog articles on financial literacy from ‘ Geld und so ’ were viewed a total of 8,813 times in 2024.

She invests Erste Group’s financial initiative ‘ she invests’ explicitly addresses the financial education of women. By positioning itself as a brand that understands the ir needs and financial situations, Erste Group offers women free financial education. This initiative includes online and live events, email courses, newsletters and recordings of webinars, providing comprehensive resources to enhance women’s financial literacy. The initiative ensures unbiased treatment of female customers by providing equal access to financial education resources, reg ardless of background or financial status. By offering a variety of formats , Erste Group ensures that all female customers have the opportunity to improve their financial knowledge and make informed decisions. PRIVACY Incident response plan Erste Group is committed to refining its incident response plan as a crucial element of its risk mitigation efforts on the topic of privacy and data processing . While clear protocols are in place for identifying, reporting, investigating, lessons learned and mitigating any potential negative impacts on customers, these protocols must be communicated and taught to all employees across the group. Investing in customer -centric training program mes ensure s all staff members are well equipped with the knowledge and skills nec- essary to handle customer data securely . In addition, Erste Group’s employees are then expected to be able to communicate effectively to its customers about the processing of their personal data . By emphasising the importance of data protection, Erste Group aims to not only safeguard its customers’ information and maintain their trust in its organisation, but also to foster a culture of responsibility by raising awareness among its employees about potential risks."

The effectiveness of action can be assessed through the participation rate and subsequent dissemination of knowledge about data processing among Erste Group employees, which was 97% for 2024. The training program me is overseen by the Group Data Protection Officer, with dedicated teams per subgroup responsibl e for organising and conducting these training sessions. Data Protection Control Framework A specific Data Protection Control Framework is used for the core markets to ensure ongoing adherence to data protection stan dards and to identify any areas requiring improvement. The design and execution of the control framework is derived from requiremen ts defined in the Group Data Protection Policy, the Group Data Processing Legitimacy Procedure, the Group Data Controller Respon si- bility Procedure, the Group Data Protection Transparency and Data Subjects Rights Procedure and the Group Data Protection Offi cer Procedure. The controls therefore cover the principles relating to processing of personal data as laid out in the GDPR. The scope of the control framework is to monitor and ensure that the policy and the procedures are properly implemented. A self -assessment is done on a local level, and afterwards approved on g roup level. Continuous monitoring and quality assurance are also done on local and group level. Security Management System The Security Management System is measured and steered by the Erste Group Security Maturity Assessment (SMA) framework. The SMA is a control self -assessment to measure the compliance of implemented security requirements as defined in s ecurity policies and procedures. The Chief Security Officer is accountable for the in time and correct execution of the SMA assessments. Also, the SMA process is integrated into the Group Policy Framework process. Group Security performs quality checks on security key -controls and, where applicable, spot checks on a regular basis. Group Security performs regular reviews with the local entity to harmo nise the quality within Erste Group. SOCIAL BANKING ( ACCESS TO PRODUCTS AND S ERVICES ) Microfinancing Erste Group’s s ocial banking initiative focuses on financing entrepreneurs to fund start -ups throughout its core markets that are not covered by regular retail business, specifically targeting clients who do not meet the eligibility criteria of the regular retail lending policy. This initiative ensures that these individuals have access to necessary financial resources, contributing to the economic stabil- ity and growth of their businesses . Social Banking departments are established in all core markets with dedicated full -time employees to support the financing of starting enterprises and micro businesses. Specific program mes include ‘Der Mikrokredit’ in Austria, which focuses on currently unemployed individuals and dedicated financing initiatives in Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia.

Every two years, a social impact assessment, including ex -post client surveys , is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives. This ongoing assessment ensures that the social banking activities continue to have a positive impact on customers. Zweite Sparkasse Based in Austria, Zweite Sparkasse seeks to address social challenges and acknowledge the dignity of every individual. The go al of Zweite Sparkasse is to permanently reintegrat e its customers into organised economic conditions. This is achieved by providing fi- nancial services to anyone who cannot find a partner to take control of their financial life. Customer eligibility is determi ned by partner social organisations that specialise i n providing financial guidance and support to people facing financial diff iculties. Zweite Sparkasse has confidence in the expertise of these partners and collaborates closely with them in providing customer service. Support for vulnerable customers contributes to Erste Groups positive impacts through improving their accessibility to financ ial products and services which creates a deeper understanding of steps they can take to improve their own financial health and s tability. The Erste Group Social Banking Impact Assessment monitors the effectiveness of the action with results being published in the Social Banking Impact Report. Furthermore, client surveys are performed every second year to indicate necessary steps to be undert aken to maximise positive impacts for its customers."

The success of this initiative can be measured through the reach that they have among these groups. The target for the FLiP tours in 2024 was to undertake a total of 15,000. The number achieved was 16,302, exceeding the set target by 1,302. The target for the FLiP APP was to reach 15,000 sessions. In 2024 a total of 20,648 sessions was recorded, exceeding the set target by 5,648. FINANCIAL HEALTH (OPPORTUNITY) Target A crucial element in enhancing the financial health of Erste Group’s customers is the implementation of financial health indi cators (previously detailed in section S4 -1, ‘Policies related to consumers and end -users’ ) throughout the Group’s various channels as well as in advisory services, both in branches and online. To achieve this, Erste Group aims to introduce these indicators across the core markets of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Czechia & Romania by the end of 20 25, with Serbia to follow in subsequent y ears. As of 2024, these indicators have not yet been integrated into any core markets. This initiative will enable customers in the impacted core markets to receive more tailored advice to achieve their financial objectives. Additionally, the calculation of these indicators will allow the Group to focus on further development in these region s, refining the advice and tools offered. A focused and tailored response to the financial needs of Erste Group’s customer base is further ai med at cementing customer loyalty to further enhance the company’s financial performance and market position. PRIVACY Due to the high level of regulation within the fields of data protection and cybersecurity, Erste Group has set no additional overarch- ing quantitative targets. However, Erste Group’s aim is continued strict compliance with the GDPR to ensure the highest le vel of protection for customer data and to prevent regulatory penalties.

The volume of social banking financing is reported quarterly by local entity departments to Erste Group. The number of financial literacy participants is reported annually by local entity departments. Job creation and ret ention are assessed through the Social Banking Impact report, performed every second year based on a representative sample of social banking clients. The number of created or preserved jobs is calculated using survey results from the previous year and is therefore estimated data .

Erste Group places a high value on ethically correct behaviour, considering it as a fundamental prerequisite for its business activities and strategic prioritie s. This com- mitment is reflected in its Statement of Purpose, which requires employees to consider not only the legality and profitability of busi- ness decisions but also whether they are the right thing to do. Building on this foundation, Erste Group’s Code of Conduct, a pproved by the management board in 2015 and updated in January 2025, sets forth binding rules and ethical principles for all employees and board members. The Code emphasi ses responsibility, respect and sustainability in all business activities. Additionally, Erste Group is committed to the principles of the UN Global Compact, which include upholding human rights, labour standards and combating corruption, drawing from key i nternational declarations and conventions. In the context of the double materiality assessment (DMA), two sustainability matters have been identified within Business Co nduct, each with positive impacts: Sustainability matter Type of IRO IRO description Value chain Time horizon G1-Protection of whistleblowers Positive impact Whistleblower protection at Erste Group positively impacts the work environment by encouraging the reporting of misconduct Upstream & Own operations Short -term G1-Corruption and bribery - Prevention and detection including training Potential p ositive impact Erste Group employees are prepared to effectively counteract potential corruption and bribery Upstream & Own operations Short -term Protection of whistleblowers Whistleblower protection at Erste Group plays a crucial role to positively impact the work environment and society by encoura ging the reporting of misconduct, therefore securing the integrity and ethical standards of the organisation. By providing a secure and confidential channel for all stakeholders to report unethical behaviour, Erste Group ensures that potential issues are addres sed promptly and effectively. Corruption and bribery – prevention and detection including training Prevention training offered to all employees is another key component of Erste Group’s strategy for its employees to countera ct po- tential corruption and bribery. By educating employees on the importance of ethical behaviour and providing them with the too ls to recogni se and prevent corruption, Erste Group strengthens its commitment to corporate responsibility and ethical business practices. Ultimately, these initiatives contribute to a positive corporate culture and enhance the reputation of Erste Group as a respo nsible and ethical financial institution. Erste Group demonstrates its commitment to ethical business conduct and reinforces its po sition as a trusted partner in the financial industry.

Therefore, Erste Gro up’s culture is aligned with its group and business strategy. Leadership plays a pivotal role in Erste Group’s culture, guided by its five leadership dimensions: out of comfort zone, servant leadership, performance impact, future orientation and client ori entation. The Code of Conduct also serves as a guide for leaders to ensure the organi sation is fit for the future while adhering to all relevant ethical standards. Erste Group regularly monitors and refines its culture through exchanges, employee feedback and 360 ° leadership evaluations to ensure it remains strong and effective. Erste Group enhances its corporate culture through leadership development, employee t rain- ing on values and ethics and engagement surveys. Erste Group also offers t own halls, open forums and onboarding program mes. Erste Group’s cultural initiatives include d iversity and i nclusion, social responsibility and s ustainability efforts. To ensure the integrity and trust in the organisation, Erste Group has implemented two key policies: the Group Risk Policy Whistle- blowing and the Policy on Conflict of Interest and Anti -Bribery and Corruption. These policies are essential components of its gov- ernance structure and contribute to an ethical and transparent work environment. Protection of whistleblowers The Group Risk Policy Whistleblowing at Erste Group establishes group -wide standards to identify, report and investigate concerns about unlawful behaviour, including unlawful behaviour in contradiction to the code of conduct. The policy is based on the EU Directive 2019/1937, the Austrian Whistleblower Protection Act and the Austrian Banking Act §99g. Erste Group provides various channels for reporting concerns, including an internet portal, mail, telephone and personal meet ings. These channels are accessible not only to employees but also to third parties, in accordance with applicable whistleblower pr otection laws. Information about whistleblowing is provided through Erste Group websites, internal mandatory trainings, annual mandato ry information sessions by team and department heads. Whistleblowing officers receive specialised training, particularly i n data protec- tion and maintain the independence necessary for their role. Detailed information regarding the process and protection against retaliation is available in the FAQ section of Erste Group’ s Whis- tleblowing platform, Erste Integrity. The ‘Erste Integrity’ system includes an internal reporting office where employees can report suspected cases or ask questions about possible violations. This office, under the C RO division, is staffed by qualified and authorised employees within the Non -Financial Risk function. Reports are received and processed confidentially according to a standardised process, with all reports being investigated and appropriate measures taken if necessary.

Correct pro- cessing of concerns is ensured through regular reporting to the Management and Supervisory Board, as well as internal and ext ernal audits. The Group Risk Policy Whistleblowing covers all employees, customers and third parties and includes a category for ‘ Unacceptable behaviour ’ to address concerns of violence, discrimination, harassment and similar misconduct. The Non -Financial Risk team within the CRO division is responsible for implementing this policy with the involvement and support of employee representatives to ensure better acceptance among employees, facilitated by a specific mutual works agreement. All policies related to employees are available on the intranet, accessible to internal stakeholders . External stakeholders are informed via Erste Group websites and the ‘ Erste Integrity ’ Whistleblowing platform on the internet. Corruption and bribery – Prevention and detection including training The Policy on Conflict of Interest (CoI) and Anti -Bribery and Corruption (ABC) directly addresses the positive impact identified in the materiality assessment, corruption and bribery - prevention and detection including training. The policy establishes com prehen- sive standards to prevent and detect conflicts of interest, bribery and corruption. The policy is derived from the Statement of Purpose and the Code of Conduct. Responsibilities and standardised procedures for managing conflicts of interest and anti -bribery and cor- ruption throughout all levels of Erste Group’s business are defined in the policy. It aims to prevent legal breaches and prot ect the company’s reputation through a responsible corporate culture, a clear compliance framework and appropriate employee qualifica-tions. This policy is implemented through prevention training offered to all employees. This training effectively counteracts potential corruption and bribery, benefiting the interests of consumers, employees and business partners and prom oting a trusting and ethical business environment.

The training provides an overview of different types of conflicts of interest, such as organisational CoI, confidential CoI and CoI regarding procurem ent or the supply chain. The WBT consists of four categories: general information, treatment of benefits, treatment of secondary activities and personal and close relationships. It details various terms to ensure a uniform understanding and presents the reportin g and approval processes for different types of CoI involving various stakeholders. The trainings are centrally defined in English and Germa n and rolled out to the entities, where they are adapted to local legislation and language. Employees must pass a kn owledge test with a rate of at least 80% at the end of the training. Additionally, a targeted training is (on top of the basic training) conducted for the Manage- ment Board, as well as employees working in the area of sponsoring, cooperations, donations and marketing due to a risk -based approach. Monitoring processes include reporting obligations via a reporting tool or email, data analysis by the Group Conduct Complian ce unit to detect material gaps for training purposes, impromptu controls when conflicts of interest arise and desk reviews. All relevant Erste Group entities and their staff must implement necessary policies, processes and infrastructure to fully support complia nce with the defined minimum standards. The policy applies across all geographies in which Erste Group operates and addresses the needs and concerns of all affected stakeholder groups. The policy is approved by all members of the Management Board, who are legally accountable and liable for the group -wide ABC policy. The document is owned by Group Conduct Compliance and follows a review cycle of two years, during which contents are reviewed and assessed based on changes in legal acts or recommendations from public authorities . Investigations regarding the pre- vention and detection of corruption and bribery are carried out by the Conduct Compliance department independently of busines s units (including staff and management). The policy is made available through the intranet for all employees and is part of the yearly compliance training that all em ployees must complete.

A corruption incident is defined as the abuse of entrusted public or business power, office, or re- sources for private gain, either by elected government officials or by other private individuals. Bribery, a form of corrupti on, is defined as the act of receiving a benefit, whether financial or non -financial, that alters the behaviour of the recipient. A bribery incident involves intentionally offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting the benefit, directly or indirectly, or through a third par ty, to improperly influence a person in the performance of a duty, to obtain or retain a benefit or any undue a dvantage, or to influence the actions of an official or other person in charge of a public or business duty. When an incident of internal fraud involving bribery or corruption is suspected, the Internal Audit function is involved to p erform a thorough audit on the matter. This ensures that all allegations are investigated independently and comprehensively. The Co nduct Compliance department, which operates separately from the chain of management, also plays a crucial role in investigating these incidents according to the 3 -Lines -of-Defense Model. This model ensures that responsibility for compliance matters, includ ing breaches of corruption and bribery, lies with Group Conduct Compliance, which reports directly to the management board. In ca se a suspicion on internal fraud occurs for an employee, who has already been dismissed, Internal Audit will perform audit steps on the matter, which might lead to legal actions. Erste Group has established rigorous procedures to prevent, detect and address allegations or incidents of corruption and bri bery. These efforts focus on ensuring compliance with financial sanctions, embargoes, securities compliance and good conduct compli ance, which includes anti -bribery and anti -corruption agendas. Regular risk -based monitoring by Compliance units ensures adherence to these procedures and raises awareness of compliance risks among all relevant staff. Critical conflicts of interest, partic ularly those indicating corruption, are reported to the Board and Supervisory Board of Erste Group Bank AG. R eports are submitted through Group Conduct Compliance to Group Internal Audit, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.

The training tackles techniques how to detect fraud, strategies to prevent and how to report fraud. The training is designed for both new and existing employees, with specific formats and frequencies to ensure comprehensive coverage. New employees re- ceive on -site fraud training available in both English and German, conducted regularly at least once a month. All emplo yees must complete the mandatory web -based fraud training available on the internal learning platform every two years. In 2022, the Policy on Conflict of Interest and Anti -Bribery and Corruption was rolled out to Erste Group Bank AG and Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG, including their major shareholdings, as well as to CEE banks and all entities of the Haf tung- sverbund (cross -guarantee system), making it applicable to over 90 entities within the Erste Group and the Austrian savings banks sector. Group Conduct Compliance monitors the fulfilment of the e -learning completion with support of the Group People Development department, which is locally responsible for implementation of and the monitoring of the e -learning and for escalating cases of non- completion. By the end of 2024, the completion rate varied across entities in Austria and CEE, depending on local factors such as the existence of a technical infrastructure for an e -learning platform, assignment date and logic, escalation process and manag ement scope and definition. Such deviating technical training credentials, especially different assignment dates and management scope and definition, explain the relatively low completion rate of 73.61% among Management Bodies (see table). The deviating training cre- dentials and definitions are strived to be steered as unified from 2025, in collaboration between Group People and Development and Group Conduct Compliance. The following data includes the completion rates of entities within the Group Compliance steering scope, which is basically b ased on majority stakes and the Compliance’s risk -based approach, the scope hence differs from the IFRS consolidation scope.

This platform will serve as a central hub for knowledge transfer, including topics such as conflicts of interest, the Policy on Conflict of Interest and An ti-Bribery and Corruption, important contact persons and notes on the web -based training. The platform aims to enhance the accessibility and dissemination of critical compliance information across the organisation. The progress of these actions is monitored through evaluations of the web -based training, data analysis of the r eporting tool, checks and risk assessments. Group Conduct Compliance, with support from the department of Group People Development (GPD), monitors the completion rates of the e -learning program mes and escalates cases of non -completion.

    "text": "243b) Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of Erste Group Bank AG, the paren t company of Erste Group. The functional curren cy is the currency of the primary busine ss environment in which an entity operates . Each entity in Erste Group dete rmines its own functional currency, and items included in the financial statements of each entit y are measured using that functional currency. For foreign currency translation, exchange rates quoted by the central banks in each country are used. Fo r Erste Group entities with the euro as functional currency, these are the European Central Ba nk reference rates. i. Transactions and balances in foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the fu nctional currency exchange rate effective as of the date of the trans- action. Subsequently, monetary assets and li abilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional curren cy ex- change rate as of the balance sheet date. All resulting exchange differences that arise are recogn ised in the statement of inco me under the line item ‘Net trading result’. Non-mo netary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as of the dates of the initial transact ions, i.e. they do not give rise to exchange differences. Non-m onetary items that are measured at fair value (such as equity investments) in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate s at the date when the fair value is measured , thus the exchange differences are part of the fair value gains or losses. ii. Translation of the stat ements of Group companies Assets and liabilities of foreign operations (foreign subsidiaries and branches) are translated into Erste Group’s presentation currency, the Euro, at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date (c losing rate). Their consolidated statement of income and conso lidated statement of comprehensive income are translated at the average exchange rate of the respective reporting period calculated on the basis of daily rates. Goodwill, intangible assets and fair va lue adjustments to the carrying am ounts of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabil ities of the foreign subsidiaries and are translated at the closing rate. However, goodwill of Česká spořitelna a.s. is translated at the historical FX ra te as allowed by the transitional provisions in IAS 21.59. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in OCI in the line ‘Currenc y reserve’ of the sta tement of comprehens ive income. The accumulated OCI is presented in equity, specifically under ‘Currency reserve’ in the statement of changes in equity . On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the cumula tive amount of translation differences recognised in ot her comprehensive income is rec- ognised in the statement of income under the line item ‘Other operating result’. c) Material accounting judgem ents, assumptions and estimates The consolidated financial"

The e stimates and assumptions used are based on histori cal experience and other factors, such as pla n- ning as well as expectations and forecasts of future events that are currently deemed to be reas onable. As a consequence of the uncertainty associated with thes e assumptions and estimates, actu al results could in future peri ods lead to adjustments in the carrying amounts of the related assets or liabilitie s. The most significant uses of judgements, assumptions and esti mates are described in the notes of the respective assets and liab ilities and relate in particular to: — Taxes on income and deferred tax assets (Note 13 Taxes on income) — SPPI assessment of financial instruments (Chapter Fi nancial instruments – Material accounting policies) — Business model assessment of financial instruments (Chapter Financial in struments – Material accounting policies) — Fair value of financial instruments (Note 26 Fair value of financial instruments) — Impairment of financial instruments (Chapter Financial instrumen ts – Material accounting polici es, Note 37 Measurement of expected credit losses and Note 40 Scenarios used in forward looking informat ion and crises effects) — Impairment of non-financial assets (Chapter Non-current assets and other investments) — Provisions (Note 53 Provisions) — Defined employees benefit plans (Note 53 Provisions) — Control of subsidiaries (Note 57 Subsidiaries) — Significant influence in associat es and joint control in joint ventures (Note 58 Investments in associates and joint ventures) — Interest in structured entities (Note 59 Unconsolidated structured entities)"

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7: Amendments to the Cl assification and Measurement of Financial Instruments. The amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 were issued in May 2024 and become effective for annu al periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026.

The amendments to IFRS 7 bring new disclosu re requirements for investment in equity in struments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for contra ctual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The amendments to IFRS 9 will result in a different way of SPPI assessment for fina"

The amendments to IFRS 7 bring new disclosu re requirements for investment in equity in struments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for contra ctual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The amendments to IFRS 9 will result in a different way of SPPI assessment for fina ncial assets whose in terest is adjusted base d on meeting certain ESG-linked targets by the borrowers. Erste Group will no longer assess them based on whether the effect of the adjustments is de-minimis but whether the ad justed cash flows could be significantly di fferent from the contractual cash flows of a financial asset with identical contractual te rms but without such an ESG- linked feature. The new asse ssment is not expected to change the measurement of the affected fina ncial assets. Other amendments to IFRS 9 ar e not expected to have a significant impa ct on Erste Group’s financial statements. Erste Group will not make use of the option to deem a financial liability that will be s ettled using an electronic payment system to be discharged before the settlement date. Amendments to IF RS 7 will result in new disclos ures. Annual Improvements Volume 11 . In July 2024 the IASB issued a set of amendm ents to various standards. The amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 10 and IAS 7 are effective for an nual periods beginning on or af ter 1 January 2026. Application of these amendments is not expected to have a significan t impact on Erste Group’ s financial statements."

    "text": "245Performance / Return 1. Segment reporting Erste Group’s segment reporting is based on IFRS 8 Operatin g Segments, which adopts the management approach. Accordingly, segment information is prepared on the basis of internal managemen t reporting that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of the segments and make decisions regarding the allocati on of resources. Within Erste Group the function of the chief operating decision maker is exercised by the management board. Erste Group uses a matrix organisational structure with geograp hical segmentation and business segments. Since the chief operat ing decision maker performs the steering primarily based on geogra phical segments, those are defined as operating segments accordin g to IFRS 8. In order to provide more comp rehensive information, the performance of the business segments is reported additionall y. Geographical segmentation (operating segments) For the purpose of segment reporting geographical segments are de fined as operating segments, for which the information is pre- sented on the basis of the booking entity’s location (not the co untry of risk). In case of information regarding a partial grou p, the allocation is based on the location of the respective parent entity according to the local manageme nt responsibility. Geographical areas are defined according to the core markets in which Erste Group operates. Based on the locations of the banki ng and other financial institution participations, the geographical ar eas consist of two core markets, Austria and Central and Eas tern Europe and a residual segment Other that comprises the remaining busine ss activities of Erste Group outside its core markets as well as the reconciliation to the co nsolidated accounting result. The geographical area Austria consists of the following three operating segments: — The Erste Bank Oesterreich & Subsidiaries (EBOe & Subsidiaries) segment comprises Erste Bank der oeste rreichischen Spar- kassen AG (Erste Bank Oesterrei ch) and its main subsidiaries (e.g. sBausparka sse, Salzburger Sparkasse , Tiroler Sparkasse, Spar - kasse Hainburg). — The Savings banks segment includes those savings ba nks which are members of the Haftun gsverbund (cross-guarantee system) of the Austrian savings banks sector and in which Erste Group does not hold a majori ty stake but which are fully controlled according to IFRS 10. The fully or majority owned Erste Bank Oesterreich, Tiroler Sparkasse, Sa lzburger Sparkasse, and Sparkass e Hainburg are not part of the Savings Banks segment. — The Other Austria segment comprises Erste Group Bank AG (Holding) wi th its Corporates and Group Markets business, Erste Group Immorent GmbH, Erste Asset Manage ment GmbH and Intermarket Bank AG. The geographical area Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) consists of six operating segments covering Erste Group’s banking subsid i- aries located in the respective CEE countries: — Czech Republic (comprising Česká spořitelna Group) — Slovakia (comprising Slovenská sporitel’ ňa Group) — Romania (comprising Banca Comercial ă Română Group) — Hungary (comprising Erste Bank Hungary Group) — Croatia (comprising Erste Bank Croatia Group) — Serbia (comprising Erste Bank Serbia"

The distinguishing factor is whethe r the EIR method is mandatorily applied fo r recognition of interest income or expens e in accordance with IFRS 9. ‘Interest income’ relates to inte rest revenue from financial asse ts measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other compre- hensive income. It is calculated using the EIR method as discu ssed in chapter ‘Financial instrum ents – Material accounting poli cies’. ‘Other similar income’ captures interest-lik e sources of income resulting from non-de rivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, held for trading de rivatives, hedge accounting derivatives, finance lease receivables and negative inte rest on financial liabilities. ‘Interest expenses’ relate to interest expe nse from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated using effective interest rate. ‘Other similar expenses’ capture interest-l ike sources of expense resulting from non-derivative financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, held for trad ing derivatives, hedge accounting derivative s, lease liabilities, provisions recogni sed under IFRS 9 and IAS 37 (unwinding of the time va lue of the money effect due to passage of time) and net defined liabilities (net int erest cost on severance payments, pensions an d jubilee obligations) under IAS 19. As regards types of financial instruments, interest income and ot her similar income include inte rest income on loans and advanc es to banks and customers, on cash balances, on debt securities in all measurement categories of financial assets, on trade and ot her re- ceivables and on finance lease receivables. Interest expenses an d other similar expenses includ e interest paid on deposits from cus- tomers, deposits from banks, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities in all measurement categories of financial liabilities and interest paid on lease liabilities. Net interest income also includes intere st on derivative financial instruments. Interest income also includes modification gains and losses recognised on financial as sets in Stage 1.

    "text": "2543. Net fee and commission income Erste Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of services that it provides to its customers. Fee and commiss ion income is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer. Erste Group recognises revenue when it transfers a promised service to a customer. Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period. These fees include commitment fee s, premiums received for financial guarantees and other fees from lending business, commission inco me from asset management, cus- tody and other management and advisory fees. Services provided over a period of time also include certain payment services like periodic card fees. Fee income earned from providing transaction services, such as arranging the acquisition and sale of shares or other securities on behalf of customers or foreign exchange transactions, as well as co mmission income earned from serv ices such as the sale of col lective investments and insurance products, are recogn ised upon completion of th e underlying transaction. Transaction based services al so include certain payment services like withdrawal fees. A contract with a customer that results in the recognition of a financial instr ument in the Group’s financial statements may be par- tially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is the case, then Erste Group first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contra ct that is in the scope of IFRS 9 and then a pplies IFRS 15 to the residual. For example, loan servicing fees agreed in a loan contract that are not integral to the effective interest rate of a financial instrument are included in t he net fee and commission income. 1-12 23 1-12 24 in EUR million Income Expenses Income Expenses Securities 275 -60 314 -57 Issues 52 -1 53 -2 Transfer orders 212 -46 249 -43 Other 12 -13 12 -12 Clearing and settlement 4 -1 2 -1 Asset management 574 -50 667 -43 Custody 135 -17 153 -21 Fiduciary transactions 1 0 1 0 Payment services 1473 -269 1614 -291 Card business 452 -178 496 -188 Current accounts from customers 770 0 686 0 Other 251 -91 432 -103 Customer resources distributed but not managed 286 -11 318 -13 Collective investment 23 -2 28 -2 Insurance products 235 -2 261 -2 Foreign exchange transactions 25 -2 26 -2 Other 3 -5 3 -7 Structured finance 1 0 6 0 Servicing fees from securitization activities 0 0 0 -2 Lending business 250 -32 252 -46 Guarantees given  guarantees received 100 -5 100 -5 Loan commitments given  loan commitments received 51 -1 60 -1 Other lending business 99 -26 92 -40 Other 105 -25 127 -41 Total fee and commission income and expenses 3104 -464 3454 -517 Net fee and commission income 2640 2938 Asset management, custody and fiduciary transa ctions fees relate to fees earned by Er"

However, although the averag e effective tax rate is below 15% , the group’s exposure to paying Pillar 2 income taxes might not be for the full diffe rence in tax rates in relation to these ju risdictions. This is due to the impact of specific adjustments envisaged in the Pillar 2 legislation which give rise to different effective tax rate s compared to those calculated in ac- cordance with IAS 12. Top-up tax for Hungary and North Macedonia was provisioned locally, as these jurisdictions have also intr o- duced Pillar 2 legislation. As their legisl ation did not include any Pillar 2 rules 20 24, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina were pr ovisioned in Austria. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES Judgement is required to determin e the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and l evel of future taxable profits, together with fu ture tax planning strategies. For this purp ose a planning period of 5 years is used."

Consequently, the deferred tax income and expenses related to temporary differences arisi ng during the financial year 2024 as well as the deferre d tax positions already recognized by the Slovakia n entities in previous years and expected to become tax effective starting with the year 2025 onwards - have been calculated - and respectively recalculated - using the newly applicable tax rates accordingly.

    "text": "263Financial instruments – Material accounting policies Accounting and measurement methods for financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract giving rise to a financ ial asset of one party and a financial liability or equity instru ment of another party. In accordance with IFRS 9, all financial assets and liabilities – whic h also include derivative financial instru ments – have to be recognised on the balance sheet and meas ured in accordance with their assigned categories. Regular way (spot) purchases and sales of fi nancial assets are recognised at the settleme nt date, which is the date that an ass et is delivered. Measurement of financial assets and financia l liabilities is subject to two primary me asurement methods: at amortised cost and fair value. i. Amortised cost and effective interest rate Amortised cost is the amount at which the fi nancial asset or financial li ability is measured at init ial recognition minus the p rincipal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest me thod of any difference between that initia l amount and the maturity amount. For financial asse ts the amount is adjusted for any loss allowance. The effective interest rate (‘EIR’) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash paymen ts or receipts through the e xpected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gro ss carrying amount of the financia l asset (i.e. its amortised cost before adjusting for any loss allowance) or to the amortised cost of the financ ial liability. The estimated cash flows consider all the contract ual terms of the financial instrument but disregard the expected credit lo sses. The calculation includes tr ansaction costs, origination f ees that are an integral part of the EIR and all other premiums and discounts to the par amount. ii. Fair Value Details on valuation techniques applied for fair value measurement and on the fair va lue hierarchy are disclosed in Note 26 Fai r value of financial instruments. Classification and subsequent me asurement of financial assets In accordance with IFRS 9, the classifica tion and subsequent measurement of financia l assets depend on the following two criter ia: — The business model for managing the financial assets; and — The cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. For further details refer to part ‘Mat erial accounting judgements, assumption s and estimates’ in this chapter. Application of these criteria leads to classification of financ ial assets into three measurement categories described in the re spective note. — Financial assets at amortised cost (AC) — Financial assets at fair value throug h other comprehensive income (FVOCI) — Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) Classification and subsequent meas urement of financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost unless they are measured at fair value through profit or los s.

Impairment of fina ncial instruments Erste Group recognises loss allowances for im pairment on its debt instrument financial assets, other than those measured at FVP L, its lease receivables, and its off-balance credit risk exposures arising from financial guarantees and certain loan commitments . The amount of the impairment loss is recognised as a loss allowance. For the purpose of the measurement of the amount of expect ed credit loss and recognition of interest income, Erste Gr oup distinguishes between th ree stages of impairment. Stage 1 relates to financial instruments for which no significant in crease in credit risk has been recorded since their initial recognition or which are subject to the ‘low credit risk exemption’ allowed by IFRS 9. The im pairment is measured in the amount equal to th e portion of lifetime expected credit losse s that result from default events possible within the next 12 months. Interest income is recog- nised by EIR applied to the gross carry ing amount of the financial asset."

    "text": "264Financial instruments in Stage 2 are subject to significant increase in credit risk since their initial recognition (and the ‘l ow credit risk exemption’ does not apply). Stage 2 also includes trade re ceivables without significant financing component to which the ‘ sim- plified approach’ is applied mandatorily based on IFRS 9 requirem ents. The impairment is measured in the amount of the lifetime expected credit loss. Interest income is recognised by EIR appl ied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (as for Stage 1). In the case of drawings by non-defaulted customers on previously committed credit lines, the whole exposure (on-balance and off - balance) is categorised as either Stage 1 or Stage 2, depending on the development of credit ri sk between the commitment date a nd the drawing date. Financial instruments in Stage 3 are credit-imp aired. In respect of applying the ‘credi t-impaired’ concept of IFRS 9, Erste Gro up adopted the approach of aligning it with the regulatory concept of ‘default’ in accordance with guidelines of the European Bank ing Authority EBA/GL/2016/07 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/171. Erste Group generally applies a customer view for the default definition, which leads to Stage 3 classification of all transactions with the customer even if the customer de faults only on one of several transactions (‘pulling e ffect’). On the other hand, an upgrade to a non-defaulted rating grade implies that a ll the transactions with the customer cease to be impaired. The impairment of financial instr uments in Stage 3 is measured in the amou nt of the lifetime expected credit loss. Interest income is calcul ated by EIR applied to the amor tised cost (i.e. the net carrying amount) of the financial asset. From a balance sheet perspective, intere st is accrued based on the financial assets’ gross carrying amo unt. The difference between the interest accrued on th e assets and the interest income recognised is reflected through the allowance acc ount (without impacting the impairment loss). For financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognit ion (purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets ’POCI’) lifetime expected credit losses are initially reflected in the cr edit-adjusted EIR. As a result, no loss allowance is recognise d at inception. Subsequently, only adverse changes in lifetime expected credit losses after the initial recognition are recognised as loss allo wance, whilst favourable changes are recognised as impairment gains increasing the gross c arrying amount of the POCI financial assets. No impairment stages are distinguished for the POCI financial assets. Measurement of expected credit losses includes cash flows expe cted from collateral and those financial guarantees held by Erste Group which are considered as integral to the contractual terms of financial assets whose risk is guaranteed. Erste Group consi ders as integral those guarantees which are entered into at or close to the inception of the guaranteed financial assets.

    "text": "265ii. Derecognition criteria with respect to contractual modifications of financial assets In the normal course of running its lendin g business and in agreement wi th the respective debtors, Erste Group may renegotiate or otherwise modify some terms or conditions of the underlying co ntracts. This can involve either market-driven commercial renegot i- ations or contractual changes aimed at alle viating or preventing borrower’s financial difficulty. For the purpose of capturing the economic substance and financial effect of such contractual modi fications, Erste Group has develo ped a set of criteria to asses s whether or not the modified terms are substantially different from the original terms and thus the financial asset has to be de recog- nised. Commercial interest rate adjustments fulfilling specific co nditions do not trigger the modifi cation significance assessment. In stead, they result in a recalculation of the EIR of related loans. Su ch interest rate adjustm ents relate to performing non-forborne fi nancial assets for which a prepayment/ear ly termination option and a suff iciently competitive refinancing market exist. Furthermore, th e costs that the debtor would incur in case of prepayment/early termination would have to be assessed as low. Such conditions int ro- duce an implicit floating rate element to the contract. This kind of interest rate adjustments rarely applies to loan assets in Stage 2. Substantial modifications lead to derecognition of the original financial asset and initial recognition of the modified financi al asset as a new financial instrument. They include following events: — change of the contractual counterpart y (unless this is a formal change such as changes in legal name); — change in the currency of the contract (unless the change results from exercising an embedded opti on in the original contract with pre-agreed conditions of the change, or if th e new currency is pegged to the original currency); — introduction of a non-SPPI contractual feat ure (unless it is intended to improve reco veries from debtors by granting concession s supporting them to recover from financial difficulties); or — removal of a non-SPPI contractual feature. Some derecognition criteria distinguish wh ether contractual modifications are applied to debtors facing financial difficulties. Appli- cation of certain modifications to debtors in financial difficulti es is not considered as substa ntial since they are aimed at i mproving the prospects of the bank to recover the claims by tailoring th e repayment schedules to specific financial conditions of those debtors. On the other hand, such contractual modifica tions applied to performing debtors may be considered as substantial enough to warr ant the derecognition, as further detailed below. From this perspective, the following criteria lead to derecognit ion unless they are considered as forbearance measures or they are applied to customers in default or they trigger default (i.e. the derecognition occurs if the modification does not relate to f inancial difficulties): — repayment schedule changed in a way that th e weighted remaining maturity of the asse ts is modified by more than"

If contractual modifications that qualify as forbearance measures or they are applied to customers in defaul t or they trigger d efault (i.e. they relate to customers in financial difficulties) are so significant that they are qualit atively assessed as an extingu ishment of original contractual rights, they result in derecognition. Exampl es of such modifications are: — a new agreement with materially different terms signed up as p art of distressed restructuring following a standstill agreement suspending the rights of the original assets; — consolidation of multiple original loans into one with substantially different terms; or — transformation of a revolving loan into non-revolving. Contractual modifications leading to dereco gnition of the related original assets result in the initial recognition of new fina ncial assets.

If the debtor is not in default or the significant modification does not lead to default, the new asset recognised after dereco gnition of the original asset will be in Stage 1. For loans measured at amortised cost, the unam ortised balance of the origination fees/tr ansaction costs considered in the effective interest ra te is presented in the line item ‘Interest income’ unde r ‘Net interest income’ at the derec- ognition date. The release of the credit loss allowance attached to the original asset at the da te of that significant modifica tion as well as the credit loss allowance recognised for the new asset are pr esented in the line ‘Impairment result from financial instrumen ts’. The remaining difference is presented in the line ‘Gains/losses from derecognition of financial asse ts measured at amortised cost’. For debt instrument assets not measured at FV PL that are subject to contractual modifica tions that do not result in derecogniti on, the gross carrying amount of the asset is ad justed against recognising a modification ga in or loss in profit or loss.

In the statement of in come, the modification gain or loss is pres ented in the line ‘Interest income’ under ‘Net interest income’ if th e modification relates to financial assets in Stage 1. For finan cial assets in Stage 2 and 3 and POCI financial assets, the modification gain or loss is presented in the li ne ‘Impairment result from fina ncial instruments’. However, to the extent that the contractual modifica tion involves the bank giving up its rights of collecting cas h flows in respect of an outstanding amount of the asset, such as waiving (part of) principal or accrued interest amount, it is treated as a write-off. iii. Write-offs Erste Group writes off a financial asset or a part of it when it has no reasonable expectations of recovering th e respective ca sh flows. When performing the write-off, the gross carrying amount of the asset is reduced si multaneously with the related loss allowance balance. Erste Group has specified criteria for writing off the unrecoverabl e balances in its loan business. Write-off can result from f orbearance measures whereby the bank contractually waiv es part of the existing balance in order to help the customers overcome financial difficulties and thus improve th e prospects of recovering the re maining loan balance (normally this relates to going concern sc enarios for corporate customers). For more information on Forbearance pl ease refer to Note 41 Restructu ring, renegotiation and forbeara nce. In gone concern scenarios with corporate customers, write-offs of the unrecoverable exposure parts are triggered by enforcement activities such as filing or termination of legal proceedings (bankruptcy, liquidation, court case). Other write-off triggers m ay result from decisions about no enforcement due to worthlessness of the claim/collateral or generally from assessment that the receivab le is economically lost. For retail customers, the non-recoverability an d the timing and amounts of write-off crystallise during the collec- tion process when it becomes evident that the amount due cannot be collected, e.g. due to ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. Resid ual uncollectable balances are written off after the collection process. iv.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES i. SPPI assessment The assessment of whether the contractual cash flows of financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of pr incipal and interest (SPPI) is subject to the applic ation of significant judgements which rely on the guidance in IFRS 9. These judgeme nts are crucial in the IFRS 9 classi fication and measurement process, as they determine whether the asset must be measured at FVPL or, depending on the business model assessment, at amortised cost or at FVOCI. When taking into consideration specific features of financial assets in the business of Erste Group, significant areas of judgement are prepayment fees, project financing loans an d inter- est rate adjustments based on the fulfil ment of certain ESG-related targets. The assessment whether the prepayment fees a pplied to loans can be considered as a re asonable compensation for early terminatio ns or prepayments is based on comparing the le vel of the fees with the economic costs incu rred by the bank upon the early terminat ion. For these purposes, Erste Group uses a qu antitative test where the co sts relate to the lost intere st margin and the lost intere st differ- ential due to a potential decrease in the interest rates upon early termination or prepayment. The adequacy of the fees can als o be defended on a qualitative basis, such as common market practice regarding the level of prepayment fees and their acceptance by authorities. For project financing loans Erste Group asse sses whether they represent basic loan agreements ra ther than investments in the fi - nanced projects. In this respect, credit rating, level of collateralisation, exi sting sponsor guarantees and the extent of equi ty funding of the financed projects are considered. In the last years financial assets whose in terest is adjusted based on m eeting certain ESG-linked targets by the borrowers (e.g . meeting specified CO2 emission targets) became p art of Erste Group’s business. Erste Group has concluded th at ESG-related interest adju st- ments have a de minimis effect on the co ntractual cash flows. As a result, they do not affect the SPPI assessment. ii.

As a consequence, the critical as pect in distinguishing the busine ss models is frequency and sig nifi- cance of sales of assets in the respective business model.

In acco rdance with IFRS 9, such su bsequent changes do not generally lead to reclassification s or prior period error corrections in respect of existing financ ial assets. The new information on how cash flows are realised m ay, however, indicate that the busi ness model, and thus the measurement method changes for newly acquired or newly originated fi- nancial assets. At Erste Group, certain sales or other dere cognition events are considered as not cont radicting the held to collect contractual cash flows business model. Examples are sales due to increases in credit risk , sales close to assets’ maturity, infrequent sales tri ggered by a non-recurring event (such as changes in regulatory or tax envi ronment, major internal reorgani sation or a business combinatio n, severe liquidity crisis, etc.) or derecognitions resulting from replacements of bonds based on an issuer’s offer. Other kinds o f sales carried out in the ‘held to collect’ busine ss model are assessed retrospectively, and if they exceed certain quantitative thres holds, or whenever it is considered necessary with regard to new expect ations, Erste Group performs a pr ospective test. If the outcome wa s that the carrying amount of assets expected to be sold over th e expected life of the current business model portfolio, for reas ons other than the cases above, exceeds 10% of the c arrying amount of the portfolio, any new acqu isitions or originations of assets would be classified in a diffe rent business model. iii. Impairment of financial instruments The expected credit loss impairment model is inherently based on judgement since it requires assessment of significant increase s in credit risk and measurement of expected cr edit losses without providing detailed guidance. In respec t of significant increases in credit risk, Erste Group has de termined specific assessme nt rules consisting of qualitative info rmation and quantitative thresholds. A nother area of complexity relates to establishing groups of similar a ssets when credit risk deteriorat ion has to be assessed on a coll ective basis before specific information is available at individual in strument level. Measurement of ex pected credit losses involves c omplex models relying on historical stat istics of probabilities of default and loss rate s in case of defaults, their extrapolations in case of insufficient observations, individual esti mates of credit-adjusted cash flows and pr obabilities of variou s scenarios including forward- looking information. In addition , the life of the instruments has to be modelled in respect of behavioural life of revolving cr edit facilities. Detailed disclosures about identification of significant increases in credit risk including collective assessment and estimatio n tech- niques used to measure 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses are provided in Note 34 Credit risk.

On the balance sheet, these assets are carried at amortised cost, i.e. the gross carrying amount net of the credit loss allowan ce. They are presented under the line ‘Financial as sets at amortised cost’, ‘Trade and other re ceivables’ and ‘Cash and cash balances’. Interest income on these assets is calculated by effective interest method and is incl uded under the line ‘Interest income’ und er ‘Net interest income’ in the statement of income. Impairment gains or losses are included in the line ‘Impairmen t result from financ ial instruments’. Gains and losses from derecogn ition (such as sales) of the assets are re ported under the line item ‘Gains/losses from derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost’. At Erste Group, financial assets at amor tised cost constitute the lar gest measurement category, which includes the vast majorit y of loan business to customers (excep t for certain loans measured at fair value thro ugh profit or loss), in terbank lending business (in- cluding reverse repo transactions), deposits with central banks, investments in debt se curities, amounts in the course of settl ement, trade and other receivables. For description of financial liabilities at measured amortised cost refer to Note 18 Financial liabilities at amortised costs. 15. Cash and cash balances Cash balances include only claims (deposits) against central ba nks and credit institutions that are repayable on demand.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income – debt instruments Debt instrument financial assets are measured at fair value thro ugh other comprehensive income (FVOCI) if their contractual cas h flows are SPPI-compliant and they are held within a business model whose objective is ac hieved by both to collect contractual c ash flows and sell the assets. On the balance shee t, they are included as ‘D ebt securities’ under the line ‘Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income’. Interest income on these assets is calculat ed using the effective interest method and is included in the line ‘Interest income’ under ‘Net interest income’ in the statement of income. Impairment gain s and losses are recognised in pr ofit or loss in the line ‘Imp airment result from financial instruments’ with oppo site loss allowance entry in OCI rather th an against the asset value. As a result, the measurement impact recognised in prof it or loss is the same as for financ ial assets measured at amortised cost. The difference between the fair value at which the assets are ca rried in the balance sheet and the amortised cost component is recog- nised as accumulated OCI in equity specific ally under ‘Fair value reserve’ in the sta tement of changes in equity. The change fo r the period is reported as OCI in the statement of comprehensive inco me in the line ‘Fair value rese rve of debt instruments’ which a lso includes the loss allowance OCI entry. When the financial asset is derecognised, the amount prev iously accumulated in OCI is re - classified to profit or loss and reported under the line ‘Other gains/losses from derecognitio n of financial instruments not me asured at fair value through profit or loss’. Erste Group classifies investments in debt securities as measured at FVOCI, i.e. no loan business is included in this measureme nt category. Similarly to investments in debt se curities measured at amortised cost, they relate to various business objectives su ch as fulfilling internal/external liquidity risk requirements and ef ficient placement of the structu ral liquidity surplus, strategic positions decided by the board of directors, initiation and fostering of cl ient relationships, su bstitution of loan bu siness or other yie ld-enhance- ment activities.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income – equity instruments For certain investments in equity instruments that are not held fo r trading, Erste Group makes use of the option to measure the m at FVOCI. This election is applied to strat egic, significant banking busi ness relationship investments (except for insurance busin ess). The fair value gains or losses for the period are reported as OC I in the line ‘Fair value reserv e of equity instruments’ of the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative gains or losses are included under ‘Fair value reserve’ in the statement of changes in equity. The amount recognised in OCI is never reclassified to profit or loss. However, upon derecognition of the investments in equity instruments at FVOCI the amount accumulated in OCI is transferred to retained earnin gs. Dividends received on these investments are reported under the line ‘Dividend inco me’ of the statement of income. On the ba lance sheet, financial assets measured at fa ir value through OCI are included as ‘Equity instruments’ under the line ‘Financial asse t at fair value through other comprehensiv e income’. The carrying amount of Erste Group’s equity instruments at FV OCI as at 31 December 2024 am ounts to EUR 109 million (2023: EUR 110 million), the cumulative fair value change for equity instruments FVOCI before taxes recognised in other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 69 million (2023: EUR 66 million). During the year 2023 and 2024, no equity instruments FVOCI were sold due to strategic business deci sions. The cumulative loss (net of tax) that was transferred from accumulated other comprehe nsive income into retained earnings amounted to EUR 3 million (2023: EUR 0 million)."

    "text": "275Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss There are various reasons for assigning the fair value through prof it or loss (FVPL) measurement category to debt instrument fi nan- cial assets. FVPL measurement relates to that are part of residual business models, i.e. they are neither held to collect contractual cash f lows nor held to either collect contractual cash flows or sell the asse ts. These financial assets are generally expected to be sold befo re their maturity or they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. In the bu siness of Erste Gr oup, such bus iness models are typical of assets that are held for trading (i.e. financial assets held by the trading function of the bank), of ass ets whose value is expected to be primarily realised through sales, such as loan syndications when the loan is offered for sale on the ma rket. Further subject to FVPL measurem ent are financial assets held by funds consolidated by Erste Group since they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Another reason for the FVPL measurement are financial assets whos e contractual cash flows are not considered as SPPI. At Erste Group, this concerns certain debt securities and loans to customers. Erste Group also makes use of the option to designate some financial assets as measured at FVPL at initial recognition. Such a clas- sification is used if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch between fixed interest rate financial asset s, which in the absence of such a classification wo uld be measured at amortised cost or at FV OCI, and related derivatives measured at FV PL. On the balance sheet, debt instrument financ ial assets measured at FVPL are presented as ‘Financial assets held for trading’, s ub- item ‘Other financial assets held for trading’ and ‘Non-trading financial assets at fair value th rough profit or loss’, sub-ite ms ‘Debt securities’ and ‘Loans and advances to custo mers’. Non-trading financial assets at FVPL consist of two sub-categories disclosed in Note 23 Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which are ‘mandatorily at fair value through profit o r loss’ and ‘designated at fair value through profit or loss’. Financial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit o r loss either because they are held as part of residual business models that are other than held for trading or their contractual cash flows are not SPPI. Investments in equity instruments th at are held for trading (i.e. financial assets held by the trading function of the bank) ar e measured at FVPL. They are included in the balance sheet under the line ‘Financial assets held for trading’, sub-item ‘Other financial a ssets held for trading’.

From IFRS 9 perspective all derivatives whic h are not designated as hedging instruments are considered as held for trading. As a result, they are measured at FVPL.

In the statement of income, the profit or loss effects of non-derivative financia l assets measured at FVPL are split into inter est income or dividend income and fair value gains an d losses. The interest income on debt instrum ents is presented in the line ‘Other sim ilar income’ under ‘Net interest income ’ and is calculated by applying the EIR to th e amortised cost component of the financial asse ts. The dividend income on equity instruments is presented in the line ‘Dividend income’. The fair value gains or losses are calcul ated net of the interest or dividend income, and they also include transaction costs and or igination fees.

Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by Erste Group to manage exposures to inte rest rates, foreign cu rrencies and other ma rket price risks. Derivatives used by Erste Gr oup include mainly interest rate swaps, futu res, forward rate ag reements, interest rat e options, currency swaps and curren cy options as well as credit default swaps. For presentation purposes, de rivatives are split into: — Derivatives – held for trading; and — Derivatives – hedge accounting. Hedge accounting derivatives are disc ussed in Note 27 Hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value (dirty price) on the balance sheet. Derivatives are carried as asset s if their fair value is positive and as liabilit ies if their fair value is negative. Derivatives – held for trading are those that are not designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting. They are presente d in the line item ‘Derivatives’ under the head ing ‘Financial assets/Financia l liabilities held for trading’. All kinds of non-hedgi ng deriv- atives without regard to their internal cl assification, i.e. both derivatives held in the trading book and banking book, are pr esented in this line item. Changes in the fair value (clean price) of derivatives – held for trading are reported in the statement of income in the line i tem ‘Net trading result’. Interest income/e xpense related to held for trading derivatives is presented in the stateme nt of income in the line item ‘Other similar income’ or ‘Other similar expenses’ under ‘Net interest income’. Inte rest income/expense recognition is based on EIR- like accruals in respect of the derivative notional amount and includes amortisation of the inception value of the derivative ( e.g. upfront fees, if any). Embedded derivatives Erste Group issues certain financ ial liabilities which contain structured features. Structured features mean that a derivative is em- bedded in non-derivative host instruments. Embedded derivatives that are separated are accounted for as stand -alone derivatives and presente d on the balance sheet under t he line item ‘Derivatives’ in financial assets held for trading an d financial liabilities held for trading. At Erste Group, these relate to bonds and deposits whose payments are linked to equity prices or FX rates. In the business of Erste Group, the majority of non-closely related embedded de rivatives relates to bond s issued for which fair value option has been applied.

Other financial liabilities relate to fund units issued by funds consolidated by Erste Group. Interest incurred is calculated b y applying the EIR to the amortised cost of the financial liability and is repo rted in the statement of income under in line item ‘Other s imilar expenses’ under ‘Net interest income’. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognised net of the interest expense under the line item ‘Gains/losses from financial instrum ents measured at fair value through profit or loss’. The amount of the fair value change resulting from the credit ri sk of the financial liability fo r the period is presented as OC I in the statement of comprehensive income in the line ‘Own credit risk reserve’. The cumulative amount is recognised as accumulated OCI , specifically under ‘Own credit risk reserve’ in the statement of changes in equity. The amount recognised in OCI is never recla ssified to profit or loss. However, upon derecogn ition (mainly repurchases) of the financial liabilities designated at FVPL the amount accu- mulated in OCI is transfer red to retained earnings. The cumulative amount of the credit risk recognised as accumu lated OCI is calculated as the difference between the present valu e of the liability determined by us ing the original credit spread and the fair value of the liability. The amount of fair value c hange attributable to changes in credit risk of the liability for the period which is reco gnised in OCI is the difference between the cumulative amount of the credit risk at the end of the period and at the beginning of the period. When calculating the present value of th e liability by using the orig inal credit spread, the rate used for discounting is the sum of the observed interest rate (swap yie ld curve) and the original credit spread.

    "text": "279Financial instruments – other disclosure matters 26. Fair value of financial instruments The measurement of fair value at Erste Group is based primarily on external sources of data (stock market prices or broker quot es in highly liquid market segments). Financial in struments for which the fair value is determ ined on the basis of quoted market pric es are mainly listed securities and listed derivatives as we ll as liquid OTC bonds. Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilit ies recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these mo dels are derived from observable market data where possible, but wher e observable market data is not available judgement is required to establish fair values. Using of unobservable inputs is particularly relevant for models used for valuations of loans and unquot ed equity investments. Disclosures on valuatio n models, the fair value hierarchy and fair values of financial instruments can be f ound subsequently. For all financial instruments the fair valu e is measured on recurring basis. Financial instruments carried at fair value DESCRIPTION OF VALUATION MODELS AND PARAMETERS Erste Group uses valuation models that have been tested internally and for which the valuation parameters (such as interest rat es, exchange rates, volatilities and credit spre ads) have been determined independently. Loans. Not SPPI compliant loans are to be valued at fair value. The methodology to compute fair value of these loans corresponds to the basic present value technique. The credit risk is recognized by adjusting contractual cash flow s to come to expected cash f lows accounting for customer’s probability of de fault (‘PD’) and loss given default (‘LGD’ ). These adjusted cash flows are then disc ounted by a yield curve which consists of a risk-free rate and a funding spread for senior unsecured issues. Debt securities. For plain vanilla (fixed and floating ra te) debt securities the fair value is ca lculated by discounting the future cash flows using a discounting curve depending on the interest rate fo r the respective issuance curren cy and a spread adjustment. Th e spread adjustment is usually derived from the credit spread curve of the issuer. If no issuer curve is available the spread is derived from a proxy instrument and adjusted for diffe rences in the risk profile of the instruments. If no close proxy is available, th e spread adjustment is estimated using other informatio n, including estimation of the credit sp read based on internal ratings and PDs or management judgment. For more complex debt securities (e.g. including option-like feat ures such as callable, cap/floor, index-l inked) the fair value is determined using combinat ions of discounted cash flow models and more sophisticated modeli ng techniques inclu d- ing methods described for OTC-derivatives.

Equity instruments. For non-trading equity instruments which do not have quoted market prices in an active market the fair value is determined by standard valuation models using also unobservable inpu t parameters. These models include the adjusted net asse t value method, the simplified income appr oach, the dividend discount model and th e comparable company multiple method. The adjusted net asset method requires an investor to measure the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities recognize d in an investee’s statement of financial position as well as the fair value of any unrecognized assets and liabilities at the measurem ent date. The resulting fair values of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities should therefore represent the fair value o f the investee’s equity. The dividend discount model assume s that the price of equity instruments issued by an entity equals the present value of all it s expected future dividends in perpetuity. Si milar to the dividend discount model, the simplified income approach estimates the f air value based on the future income. However, it can be used also when only one year planned income is available. The simplified income approach and the dividend discount model discount future income and dividend s using the cost of equity. The cost of equi ty is dependent on the risk-free rate, the mark et risk premium, the levered beta and the country risk premium. The levered beta is derived from the industry classification which is published and maintained by Damodaran. In rare cases, techniques for non-trading equity instruments may also include compar able company multiple methods. These are valuation techniques that use prices and ot her relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable compa ny"

For issued debt securities where the fair value cannot be retrieved from quoted market prices, the fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. Sign ificant input factors for the spread adjustm ent of Erste Group’s own credit risk for the respective seniority class are cr edit spreads derived from liquid benchmark bond s and additional indications from external inve st- ments banks, which are provided on a regul ar basis. The applied spreads are validated on a regular basis from an independent Ri sk Management unit. In case of issued securiti es with structured features, optionality is taken into account as well when calculat ing the fair value. OTC-derivative financial instruments. Derivative instruments traded in liquid mark ets (e.g. interest rate swaps and options, for- eign exchange forward and options, options on listed securities and indi ces, credit default swaps an d commodity swaps) are valu ed by using standard valuation models. These models include discount ing cash flow models, option mo dels of the Black-Scholes and Hull-White type as well as hazard rate models. Models are calibr ated on quoted market data (including implied volatilities). Va luation models for more complex instruments also us e Monte-Carlo simulation. For instruments in less liquid markets, data obtained from less frequent transactions or extrapolatio n techniques are used. For determining the fair value of collateralised derivatives a discount- ing interest rate reflecting th e interest rate of the corresponding cash collateral is used. Erste Group values derivatives at mid-market levels. To reflect the potential bid-ask-spread of the relevant positions an adjus tment based on market liquidity is performed. The adjustment parameters depend on product type, currency, maturity, liquidity and no- tional size. Parameters are reviewed on a regular basis or in case of significant market moves. Credit value adjustments (CVA) for counterp arty risk and debit value adjustments (DVA) for own default credit risk are applied to OTC derivatives. For the CVA the adjustment is driven by the expe cted positive exposure of the derivative and the probability o f default of the counterparty. The DVA is driv en by the expected negative exposure of the derivative and Er ste Group’s probabilit y of default. The modeling of the expected expo sure is based on option replication strateg ies or Monte-Carlo si mulation techniques. The accumulated CVA-adjustments amounted to EUR 15 million (2023: EUR 14 million) an d the total DVA-adjustment amounted to EUR 9 million (2023: EUR 12 million).

VALIDATION AND CONTROL The responsibility for valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value is independent of the trading units. In additi on, Erste Group has implemented an independent validation function in orde r to ensure separation between units responsible for model de- velopment, fair value measurement and valida tion. The aim of independent model validati on is to evaluate model risks arising fr om the models’ theoretical foundation, th e appropriateness of input data (m arket data) and model calibration. Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and financial li abilities measured at fair value are categorized under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Level 1 measurements include exchange traded derivatives (options), shares, government bonds as we ll as other bonds and funds, which are traded in highly li quid and active markets. LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY In case a market quote is used for valuation but due to restricte d liquidity the market does not qualify as active (derived fro m available market liquidity indicators) the instrument is classified as Level 2. If no market prices are available the fair value is measu red by using valuation models which are based on observable market da ta. For Level 2 valuations typically yield curves, credit spreads and implied volatilities are used as observable market parameters. Level 2 measurements include OTC derivatives, theoretically priced exchange traded derivatives, less liquid shares, bonds and f unds as well as asset backed se curities (ABS), collateralized debt obli gations (CDO), own issues and deposits."

    "text": "281LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY If any unobservable input in the valuation model is significan t or the price quote used is updated infrequently the instrument is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Typically cred it spreads derived from internally calculated historical proba bility of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) measures are used as unobservable parameters. Furtherm ore, internally calculated cost of equity and adjustments made on the equity (in the adjusted net asset valu e method) are unobservable parameters for the valuatio n of non-trading equity instruments. The volume of Level 3 financ ial assets can be allocated to the following categories: — Derivatives where the credit value adjustmen t (CVA) has a material impact and is calc ulated based on unobservable parameters (i.e. internal estimates of PDs and LGDs). — Illiquid bonds, shares, participations and funds not quoted in an active market wher e either valuation models with non-observab le parameters have been used (e.g. credit spreads) or broker quotes have been used that cannot be allocated to Level 1 or Level 2. — Loans which do not comply with the contractual cash flow criteria. — Own issues if price updates are no t provided on a regular basis. The allocation of the appropriate le vel of positions is determined at the end of the reporting period. A reclassification from Level 1 into Level 2 or Level 3 as well as vice versa will be performed if the financial instrument doe s no longer meet the criteria described ab ove for the respective level.

Hedge Accounting Erste Group makes use of derivative instrum ents to hedge exposures to interest rate ri sk and foreign currency risk. As permitte d by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, Er ste Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 . On the balance sheet, derivatives designated as hedging instrumen ts are carried at fair value (dir ty price). They are presented in the line item ‘Hedge accounting deri vatives’ on the asset or liabilit y side depending on whether thei r fair value is positive or ne gative. i. Fair Value Hedge For qualifying and designated fair value hedges, the change in the fair value (clean price) of a hedging instrument is recognis ed in the statement of income under the line item ‘Net trading result’. Interest income and expenses on hedging derivatives are repor ted in the line item ‘Other similar income’ or ‘Other similar expenses’ under ‘Net interest income’. The change in the fair value of t he hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is al so recognised in the statement of income un der the line item ‘Net trading result’ and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item. Erste Group also applies portfolio fair va lue hedges of interest rate risk as regu lated by IAS 39.AG114-AG132. For this purpose , Erste Group makes use of the relaxation provided by the EU-carve out fo r so called ‘bottom layer’ hed ges. More details are discussed in part ‘Hedges of interest rate risk’ below. The change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged interest risk in portfolio fair value hedges is presented on the balance sheet un der the line item ‘Fair value changes of hedged items in portfo lio hedge of interest rate risk’. For terminated hedges the fair value adjustment of the hedged it em is amortised until maturity of the financial instrument. In the statement of income the amortisation is pr esented under ‘Net interest income’ in the li ne item ‘Interest income’ if the hedged item was a financial asset or in the line item ‘Interest expenses’ if the hedged item was a financial liability. For portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk the fair value adjustm ent related to the terminated hedge is amor tised to the"

Cashflow Hedge For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective po rtion of the gain or loss on th e hedging instrument is recognis ed as OCI in the line ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ of the statement of comprehensive income. The accumulated other comprehensive income is presented under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ in the statement of changes in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the state ment of income under the line item ‘Net trading result’. For determination of the effec- tive and ineffective portions, the derivative is considered at its clean price, i.e. excluding the interest component. When the hedged cash flow affects the statement of income, the gain or loss on the hedging instr ument is reclassified from other comprehensive income on the corresponding income or expense line item in the statement of income (mainly ‘Other similar income’ or ‘Other similar ex - penses’ under ‘Net interest income’) . As far as accounting for hedged items in cash flow hedges is concerned, there is no chang e compared to the situation wh en no hedging is applied. For terminated hedges the cumulative gain or loss on the hedg ing instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income remains in ‘Cash flow hedge re serve’ until the transaction occurs. iii. Net Investment Hedge For designated and qualifying net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is rec ognised as OCI in the line ‘Currency reserve’ of the statement of comprehensive income.

HEDGES OF INTEREST RATE RISK As an inherent part of its bu siness Erste Group is exposed to interest rate ri sk arising from the interest characteristics and behavior of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. This relates to the ex isting balance sheet items as well as to expected dev elopment of the balance sheet and banking activities. Interest rate risk can generally be defined as a potential deterioration of a bank’s financial condition in reaction to adverse mo vements in market interest rates. Hedge accounting activities relate to inte rest risk bearing exposures in the banking book. The interest rate risk of the bankin g book is managed by Group Asset Liability Managemen t (ALM). Interest rate risk management acti ons of ALM are approved as part of the ALM strategy by Group Asset Liability Committ ee (ALCO). For hedging relationships qual ifying for hedge accounting hedge effec- tiveness is measured by risk management unit whic h is independent from ALM as the risk taker. The objective of the interest rate risk management in the banking book is to optimise the risk and return of interest rate risk exposures. For this purpose and for compliance with external and internal regulations and limi tations Erste Group manages the interest rat e risk from the earnings and economic value perspectives. The foca l point of the interest rate risk analysis from the earnings pe rspective is the variation in earnings, i.e. the net in terest income. The changes in interest rate s have an impact on the bank’s earnings via its distinct impact on interest income and inte rest expenses accrued on assets and liabilit ies, respectively. The economic value pe rspec- tive views the interest rate risk as changes in the economic value of equity. It can be identified as the present value of cash -flows arising from asset, liability and off-balanc e-sheet items. Change in inte rest rates alters both the si ze of future cash-flows a nd the value of discount rates applied in the calculation. Existing balance sheet items and contributions of planned or forecast transactions are analysed through the earnings and econom ic value-based metrics. Erste Group keeps the ri sk within predefined limits. When actively managing interest rate risk ALM gives p ref- erence to entering into bonds and derivatives. In general, the po licy of Erste Group is to swap all substantial fixed or struct ured issued bonds to floating items.

In general, the po licy of Erste Group is to swap all substantial fixed or struct ured issued bonds to floating items. In addition of managing the interest rate risk using deriva tive transactions and investments in bonds, also the intended non-hedging of benchmark issues with derivatives is used for managing the interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are the most common derivatives used to mana ge interest rate. If fixed rate repricing profiles of assets or liabilities do not fit to the interest rate risk management strategy they are swapped into variable rate items (usually 3-month money marke t rate such as EURIBOR). In other cases, variable rate repricing profiles of assets or liabilities may need to be swapped into fi xed rate items. Erste Group employs hedge accoun ting to address accounting mi smatches resulting from different measurement requirements for derivatives which are measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets and liabilities in the banking book me asured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Some of the acco unting mismatches ar e addressed by desig - nating financial assets or financial liabilit ies as measured at FVPL (fair value opti on) without the need to use hedge accounti ng. Fair value hedges address the risk managemen t activities of swapping fixed rate assets or liabilities into variable rate. On th e other hand, cash flow hedges are used when floa ting rates assets or liabilitie s are swapped into fixed ones (please refer also to the discussion of proxy hedges below). For hedges of interest rate risk of portfolios of prepayable fixed rate loans Erste Group appl ies requirements for portfolio fa ir value hedges of interest rate risk as regulated by IAS 39.AG114-AG132. For this purpose, Er ste Group makes use of the relaxation prov ided by the EU-carve out and hedges the interest ra te risk in respect of so called ‘bottom layer’ amount. The bottom layer amount is expected not to be affected by prepaymen ts of loans (including a margin of conserva tism). Thus, it represents a stable fixed in terest rate exposure which is hedged by using in terest rate swaps. With this approach, any prepayments, other derecognitions and impai r- ments are attributed to the un-h edged buffer amount above the designated bottom layer. Thus, they"

I.e. the fair value volatility resulting from changes in the spread of the hedged fixed rate instrument over the swap yield curve is exc luded from hedge accounting and is not accounted for. Similarly, in cash flow hedges the hedged risk is designated in respect of the variable cash flows portion equal to the interes t index of the swap (such as EURIBOR).

    "text": "289The hedging interest derivatives are economically related to the he dged interest rate risk component of the hedged item. The no n- interest components (such as credit spreads) of the hedged items are outside the hedg ing relationship. As a result, comparable valu- ation inputs are applied on both sides of th e hedging relationship. Thus offsetting effects are recognised to the extent the ec onomic relationship exists with out giving rise to artificial volati lity in profit or loss. The hedged interest risk component is the m ost significant factor affecting fair value changes of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges of deposits with central banks (disclosed un der the line ’Interbank loans/re pos’ below) no forward-looking curve over the hedging period exists for the hedged interest rates (such as DFR of the EC B or two-week repo rate of the CNB). I n such cases the hedged risk is replicated by another rate for which the forward-looking curve exists (such as €STR swap curve or 1M PRIBOR swap curve). A proof of a strong co rrelation between the rates is necessary. The designated hedging relationships normally correspond to the economic hedges set up by ALM when managing the interest rate risk. However, in some cases, the hedging derivatives may not be direct ly related to specif ic assets or liabilities but they ma nage the overall interest risk position. Also, the de rivatives may relate to instruments which do not qualify as hedged items under the IFRS hedge accounting requirements. In order to account for risk miti gating effects of su ch derivatives Erste Group searches for sui table hedged items providing the best fit to the te rms of the derivative and designates an effective hedging relationship (so called proxy hedges). Typically cash flow hedges of variable rate assets ar e designated on such a basis whereby the actual economically hedg ed risk may result from modelled fixed rate profile of demand deposit liabilities. The hedge ratio is chosen in compliance with the rules defined in IAS 39. The volume of the hedging instrument which is designa ted for the hedge relation can never be greater than the volume of the hedged item. If the notional of a hedging derivative is grea ter than the notional of the hedged item the respecti ve proportion of the derivative is design ated as hedging instrument. Further, the t enor of the hedging instrument is never longer than the tenor of the hedged item. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness can result from: — designation of hedging instruments an d hedged items during their life rather than from their inception — different discounting curves applied fo r hedged item and hedging instrument — different interest tenors of hedging swaps and he dged variable rate items in cash flow hedges — volatility of present value of floating l eg of hedging swaps in fair value hedges — different trade dates for the hedgin g instrument and the hedged item — real prepayments"

Sources of hedge ineffectiveness can result from: — designation of hedging instruments an d hedged items during their life rather than from their inception — different discounting curves applied fo r hedged item and hedging instrument — different interest tenors of hedging swaps and he dged variable rate items in cash flow hedges — volatility of present value of floating l eg of hedging swaps in fair value hedges — different trade dates for the hedgin g instrument and the hedged item — real prepayments of a loan portfolio deviating from expected prepayments — credit risk adjustments (CVA, DV A) on the hedging derivatives Notional amounts of hedged items – hedges of interest rate risk Notional amount in EUR million Type of hedged items Dec 23 Dec 24 Fair value hedges Assets Portfolios of client loans 234 1198 Assets Single loans 270 268 Assets Bonds at FVOCI 981 838 Assets Bonds at AC 2594 5872 Liabilities Issued bonds 19702 22804 Liabilities Other liabilities/repos 50 50 Cash flow hedges Assets Interbank loans/repos 1463 564 Assets Client loans 1395 1608 Portfolio hedges of defined bottom layer am ounts (bottom layer hedges) are disclosed in the table with the nominal hedged botto m layer amounts.

HEDGES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The objective of foreign exchange risk management in the banking b ook is to avoid profit or loss impacts of unfavorable market movements of foreign exchange rates. Only a minor part of foreig n exchange risk management activities requires using of hedge accounting. Currently bonds and loans with notional amou nt of EUR 1,637 million (2023: EUR 1,761 millio n) are hedged in ca sh flow hedges by using cross currency swaps as he dging instruments. FX swaps with notional amou nt of EUR 180 million (2023: EUR 206 million) are used as hedging instrument in hedges of in terest accruals on financial assets in fore ign currency. Sources of hedge ineffective ness can result from the hedged cash flows falli ng under the hedged volume and from credit risk adjustments (CVA, DVA) on the hedgin g derivatives."

Erste Group undertakes interest rate derivative transactions via London Clearing House and EUREX by fulfilling all offsetting r e- quirements according to IAS 32. Offsetting is carried out between gross asset and liability deriva tive positions. The net deriv ative position is further offset with variation m argin amounts. As a result, the offsetting of derivatives has to be viewed in relati on to the variation margin assets and liab ilities balances. The sum of the amounts offset in the lines ‘Derivatives’ and ‘Variation margi n assets’ in the table for financial assets equals th e sum of the amounts offset in the lines ‘Derivatives’ and ‘Variation margin liabili ties’ in the table for financial liabilities. The variation margin assets are presented under the balance sheet items ‘Cash and cash balance s’. The variation margin liabilities are presented under the balance sheet item ‘Financial li abilities measured at amortised cost’, sub item ‘Deposits from banks’. Erste Group employs master netting agreements and repurchase agreements as a means of reducing credit risk of derivative and financing transactions. They qualify as potential offsetting agreements. Master netting agreements are relevant for co unterparties with multiple de rivative contracts. They provide for the net settleme nt of all the contracts in the event of default of any counterparty. For derivatives transactions the values of assets and liabilitie s that would be set off as a result of master netting agreements are presented in the column ‘Fin ancial instruments’. If the net position is further secured by cash collateral or other fina ncial collaterals the effects are disclosed in columns ‘Cash collateral received / pled ged’ and ‘Other financial collateral received / pledged’ respectively. Repurchase agreements are primarily financing transactions. They ar e structured as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securiti es at a pre-agreed price and time.

Transfers of financial assets – repurcha se transactions and securities lending Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements Transactions involving sales of securities un der an agreement to repurchase them at a specified future date are also known as ‘ repos’ or ‘sale and repurchase agreements’. Securit ies sold in such transactions are not de recognised from the balance sheet, as Erste Group retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, because the securities are repurchased at a fixed price when the tran saction ends. Furthermore, Erste Group is the bene ficiary of all coupons and other income pa yments received on th e transferred assets o ver the period of the transactions. These payments are remitted to Erste Group or are reflecte d in the repurchase price. The cash received upon sale of securities is recognised on the balance sheet wi th a corresponding obligation to return under th e line item ‘Financial liabilities at amortised co st’, sub-items ‘Deposits from banks’ or ‘D eposits from customers ’ reflecting the tra nsaction’s economic substance as a loan to Erste Group .

The risk strategy describes the current and targeted risk profile, defines risk management principles, strategic goals, and ini tiatives for the main risk types as well as sets str ategic limits for the significant financial and non-financial risk types as defined in the Risk Materiality Assessment. The risk strategy is executed within a clearly defined govern ance structure. This structure also applie s to monitoring of risk appetite, addi tional metrics, as well as to th e escalation of limit breaches. Erste Group is publishing online its disc losures under Article 434 of the Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on prudential requiremen ts for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regula tion - CRR) and Regulation (EU) No. 876/2019 amending Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013. Details are av ailable on the website of Erste Group at www.erstegroup.com/ir. Relevant disclosure s are included in the annual repo rt in the section ‘Reports’ or published as sepa rate documents in the section ‘Regulatory disclo sure’. Risk management organisation Risk monitoring and control is achieved th rough a clear organisational structure with defi ned roles and respon sibilities, deleg ated authorities, and risk limits. The management board and in particular Erste Group’s Chief Risk Officer (Group CRO) pe rform the oversight function within Erste Group’s risk management structure . Risk control and risk steering within Erste Group are performed based on the business strate gy and risk appetite approved by the management board. The Group CR O, working together with the chie f risk officers of the subsidi - aries, is responsible for the implementation and adherence to the risk control and ri sk management strategies across all risk t ypes and business lines. The management board and, in particular the Group CRO, ensure th e availability of appropriate infrastructure and staff as well as methods, standards and proc esses to that effect; the actual identification, measurement, asse ssment, approval, monitoring, stee ring and limit setting for the relevant risks are performed on the operating entity le vel within Erste Group. At group level, the management board is supported by several di visions established to perform op erating risk control functions and exercise strategic risk managemen t responsibilities. The fo llowing risk management functions report directly to the Group CRO: — Group Liquidity and Mark et Risk Management; — Enterprise wide & Operati onal Risk Management; — Credit Risk Methods; — Group Compliance; — Retail Risk Management: — Credit Risk Portfolio; — Corporate Risk Management; — Cyber Risk Management; —"

In addition, committees are established at local level, such as the ‘Team Risikomanagement’ in Au stria. It is responsible for a common risk approach with the Austrian savings banks. Group-wide risk and capital management Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) includ es as its fundamental component the Inte rnal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) as required under Pillar 2 of the Basel framework and regulatory guides (e.g., ECB Guide to ICAAP). The ERM framework is designed to support the management of the bank in managing the risk portfolios as well as the coverage potential and to ensure that the bank alwa ys holds adequate capital for the nature an d magnitude of its risk profile. The frame work is tailored to the Erste Group’ s business and risk profile and reflects the strategi c goal of protecting shareholders and senio r debt holders while ensuring the susta inability of the organisation. ERM framework is a modular and comprehensive management and steer ing system within Erste Group as well as an essential part of the overall steering and management instruments. The ERM compon ents necessary to ensure all as pects, in particular to fulfil regulatory requirements and to prov ide an effective internal steering tool, can be clustered as follows: — Risk Appetite Statement (RAS ), limits and risk strategy; — portfolio and risk analytics including Risk Materiality Assessment (R MA), concentration risk ma nagement, and stress testing; — Risk-bearing Capacity Calculation (RCC); — capital allocation and performance management; — planning of key risk indicators; — recovery and resolution planning. In addition to the ICAAP’s ultimate goal of assuring capital adequacy and sustainabil ity at all times, the ERM components serve to support the bank’s management in pursuing its strategy. RISK APPETITE Risk appetite defines the maximum level of risk Erste Group is willing to accept in pursuing its business goals. The overall ap proach includes a risk appetite statement, risk li mits, and the roles and respon sibilities of those overseeing the implementation and moni- toring of the risk appetite framework.

    "text": "298The core risk metrics are set as ultimate boundaries for the Group risk-return target setting. They are also a key part of the annual strategic planning / budgeting process and give an overall picture of capital, liquidity, and risk-return trade-offs. The key o bjective of the RAS is to: — ensure that Erste Group has sufficient re sources to support its business at any give n point in time and absorb stress events; — set boundaries for the Grou p’s risk target setting; — support the group’s financial strength and the robustness of its systems and controls. To foster risk-return steering and to ensure proactive management of the risk profile, Erste Group creates its RAS on a forward - looking basis. External constraints such as regulatory requirements create the floor and ceiling for the RAS and therefore the amount of risk Erste Group is willing to accept. To ensure that the gr oup remains within the targeted risk profile, a traffic light sy stem was established and assigned to the core metric s. This approach allows a timely delivery of information to the respective governanc e and the implementation of effective remediation measures. The RAS traffic light system is defined as follows: — RAS is green: The target risk profile is within the specified boundaries. — RAS is amber: The undershooting or overshoot ing of a pre-defined threshold leads to an escalation to the designated governance and the discussion of pote ntial remediation actions. — RAS is red: The undershooting or overshootin g of a pre-defined limit initiates an imme diate escalation to the designated govern - ance and a prompt implementati on of remediation actions. Moreover, stress indicators are defined for selected core metrics and integrated into the assessment of th e stress test results . They are reported as early warning signals to the management board to support proactive management of the risk and capital profile. In addition, supporting metrics and principles are defined by material risk type in th e Group Risk Strategy based on Group RAS. These support implementation of the mid- to long-term strategy. Risk management governan ce ensures full over sight of risk deci- sions and sound execution of the Group risk strategy. Mitigating actions are undertaken as part of the regular risk management process to ensure that the Gr oup remains within its RAS. Group RAS is also cascaded to local entiti es. Local RAS is approved by the management board to ensure compli ance with the Group RAS and approved also by the local management board to ensure al ignment with local regulatory re quirements.

Erste Group’s defini tion of ESG risk drivers is p art of the Group ICAAP Policy and covers a wide range of environmental, social and governance factors. PORTFOLIO AND RISK ANALYTICS Erste Group uses dedicated infrastructure, sy stems and processes to actively identify, measure, control, report and manage risk s within its portfolio.

    "text": "299Risk concentration analysis Erste Group has implemented a proc ess to identify measure, control and manage risk concentrations. This process is important to ensure the long-term viability of Erste Grou p, especially in times of an adverse busi ness environment and stressed economic con ditions. The risk concentration analysis at Erste Group is performed on an annual basis covering credit risk, market risk, operational r isk, liquidity risk and inter-risk concentrations . Identified risk concentrations are considered in the scenario design of the compr ehensive stress test and measured unde r stressed conditions. The output of the risk conc entration analysis additionally contributes to t he identification of material risks within the RMA and to the setting/calibration of Erste Group’s limit system. Stress testing Modelling sensitivities of the group’s asse ts, liabilities and profit or loss provid e management steering information and help to opti- mise Erste Group’s risk-return profile. St ress tests help to factor in severe but pl ausible scenarios prov iding further robustn ess to measurement, steering and management. Risk modelling and stress testing are vital forward-lookin g elements of the ICAAP. Finall y, sensitivities and stress scenari os are considered within th e group’s planning process. Erste Group’s most complex stress testing activities are scenario stress tests that take a comprehe nsive account of the impact of various economic scenarios. This includes se cond-round effects on all major risk type s (credit, market, liquidity and operation al) and effects on the associated volume s of assets and liabilities as well as on profit and loss. In addition to the standard scenario -driven stress testing exercise s, reverse stress tests are performed to identify a scenario or a combin ation of scenarios in which viab ility of the current business model can be questioned. Erste Group has developed specific tools to translate macroeconomic variables (e.g., GD P or unemployment rate) into risk parame ters to support the stress testi ng process, which combine bottom-up and top-down approaches. For adapting the stress parameters, Ers te Group additionally leverages the experience of its local profe ssionals and uses, where appropri ate, their statistical models to simulate the impacts of macroeconomic variables on th e risk parameters in the respective portfolios. Special attention is taken to accou nt for the granularity and special charac teristics (i.e., countries and industries) when determining th e segmentation in which the str essed parameters are defined. Erste Group has integrated climat e risk analysis into the intern al stress testing framework. Both physical risk and transition risk from projected climate change are now included in the internal stress testing framework.

RISK-BEARING CAPACITY CALCULATION The Risk-bearing Capacity Calculation (RCC) describes the methodology of Pillar 2 capita l adequacy calculation. In contrast to the normative (regulatory) view of Pillar 1, referring to the Group’ s ability to fulfil all its capital-related regulatory and supe rvisory require- ments and demands, the RCC is based on an economic view of Pill ar 1+ approach, assuming continua tion of Erste Group as expected by the ECB Guide to ICAAP. The RCC determines whether the Group has sufficient internal capital for covering all (regulatory an d economic) risks it is exposed to. Economic an d normative perspectives at Erste Group ar e set in a way to mutually inform each o ther and are integrated into all material busine ss steering activities and decisions. In a ddition, with applied Pillar 1+ approach t he Group increases efficiency and ensures comparabilit y with the Pillar 1 calculation. Based on the results of the RMA, the economic cap ital is considered for relevant risk types as approved by the management board. The economic capital requirement is then compared to in - ternally available capital (coverage potential) to cover the Grou p’s risks in Pillar 2. Both economic capital and cover-age pot ential are computed on the CRR scope of consolidation of Erste Group as ultimate parent entity based on IFRS accounting standards. Besides the Pillar 1 risk types (c redit, market in trading book, FX in banking book and operational risks), concentration risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, cr edit spread risk in the banking book as well as business risk are explicitly considered within the economic capital calculated over a horizon of one year and at a confidence level of 99.9%.

The largest portion of economic capital requirements is coming from credit risk, which account s for 70.8% of total economic capital requirements at the end of 2024.

The coverage potential must be sufficient to absorb Pillar 2 risk s/unexpected losses resulting from the Group’s operations at a ny point in time (normal and stressed), as reflected in the Group’s Risk Appetite through the limits set for Group economic capital adeq uacy and stressed capital adequacy utilisation. At the end of 2024, th e economic capital adequacy was at 63.2%, fully in line with g roup RAS. The management board and supervisory board (i ncluding risk committee of supervisory board) are briefed quarterly on the results of the ICAAP capital adequacy through the Group Risk Report. The includes risk profile developments, available capital (coverag e potential), consideration of potential losses in stress situatio ns, the degree of the risk limit utilisation and the overall st atus of capital adequacy. RISK PLANNING Group Risk Planning framework is essentia l for the capital allocation and overall fi nancial planning processes and supports the adequate reflection of risks within the strategy, steering and management processes of the group. Methods and instruments applied Key risk indicators covered by the Risk Planning framework includ e indicators that provide an overview of incurred or potential risks, with respect to both po rtfolio and economic environment developments. Indi cators include RWA (and related indicators), p ort- folio quality indicators (impairments, NPL/NP E and relevant performance indicators, etc.), as well as indicators required by th e regulatory authorities under the resp onsibility of the Risk division. Planning activities are performed in clos e cooperation with all stakeholders in the group´s overall process and follow a clear govern- ance structure to ensure so und risk planning process. Capital allocation An important task integral to the risk planning process is the allocation of capital to entities, business lines and segments. This is done with close cooperation between Risk Management and Controlli ng. Methodology for allocation reflects risk and controlling processes to allocate capital wi th risk-return considerations.

The CMDI legislative package was endorsed by the European Parliament and the Council and is current ly subject to interinstitutional negotiations between these bodies. The amendments to the Daisy Chain deduction regime were implemented through a Directive that was published in the Official Journal of the European Unio n in April 2024 and is applicable since November 2024. The other parts of the CMDI package could enter into force in 2025 and be applicable in 2027. Recovery Planning. In compliance with the current Austrian Banking Reco very and Resolution Law (‘Bundesgesetz über die Sani- erung und Abwicklung von Banken – BaSAG’), Erste Group annually su bmits a Group Recovery Plan to Joint Supervisory Team (JST). ECB regularly assesses the Group Re covery Plan. The Group Recovery Plan identifi es potential options for the replenishment of capital and liquidity resources of the bank in order to cope with a range of se vere scenarios including both idiosyncratic and market- wide stress. The Recovery Framework is main ly reconciled with the Risk Appetite Framework across in dicators and indicator thres h- olds, ensuring comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management. It is relevant to demonstrate that in a severe stress, which is c lose to a failing or likely to fail situation, there is sufficient reco very capacity available to be able to recover back into the r ecovery green zone. The recovery governance described in the plan ensures timely identi fication and proper management of a recovery situation of Erste Group. Furthermore, the assessment of the Group Recovery Plan and the assessment of the overall recovery capacity are par t of the Supervisory Review and Evalua tion Process (SREP) assessment. Resolution Planning. Erste Group collaborates with the resolution authorities in the drawing up of resolution pl ans as required by BaSAG and EU Regulation No 806/2014 establ ishing the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM Regulation). The legislative framework allows for a multiple-point-of-entry (MPE) or a single-point-of- entry (SPE) resolution strategy. The Resolution Authorities for med a joint decision in the resolution college for Erste Group which de fines the MPE approach forming seven separate resolution group s with Erste Group’s core CEE subsidiaries an d Austria, but with SPE approa ches on country level. This results in having resoluti on groups in AT, CZ, HR, HU, RO, SI and SK. Under the MPE strategy, a group has more than one Resoluti on Entity Level which is the entry point for resolution.

MREL notifications are pr ovided by the national reso lution authorities on the le vel of resolution groups an d relevant individual subsidiaries of resolu tion entities, reflecting th e resolution strategy, based on the MREL joint decision t aken by the resolution college. MREL requirements are expressed as a perc entage of the total risk exposure amount (TREA) as well as lev er- age ratio exposure (LRE). Based on the MREL joint decisions taken, th e National Resolution Authorities provided their legal notifications. In April and M ay 2024, Erste Group received Joint Decision de termining the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities for its re so- lution groups and some non-resolu tion entities (i.e. direct and indirect subsidi aries of resolution entities). The requirement is set including binding requirements applicable from the date of the re ceipt of the notification of th e act of the relevant national resolution authority. Information on MREL targets have been published on the local entities’ we bsite based on legal notifications released by the relevant national reso lution authorities.

All requirements as defined in the CRR, th e ABA and in technical standards issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) are applied by Erste Group for regulatory purposes. Furthermore Erste Group also fulf ils capital requirements determined in the Supe rvisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). 1 Both CRD IV and CRR have been amended since the entry into force in 2014 inter alia with directive (EU) 2019/878 (CRD V) as w ell as regulations (EU) 2019/876 (CRR 2) and (EU) 2020/873 (CRR Quick Fix). 2 CRDV has been transposed by an amendment of the ABA (BGBl I 2021/98; BWG-Novelle) which entered into force on 31 May 2021."

    "text": "302Accounting Principles The financial and regulatory figures publishe d by Erste Group are based on IFRS. Eligib le capital components are derived from t he balance sheet and income statement which were prepared in accordance with IFRS. Regulatory scope of consolidation and institutional protection scheme The consolidated regulatory own funds and the consolidated regulatory capital requirements are calculated based on the scope of consolidation stipulated in the CRR. The de finition pursuant to CRR di ffers from the scope of consolidation according to IFRS, which also includes insurance companie s and other entities, that are subject to full consolidation. Erste Group Bank AG is a member of the Ha ftungsverbund (cross-guarantee system) of th e Austrian savings bank sector. As of the balance sheet date Erste Group Bank AG and Erste Bank der oeste rreichischen Sparkassen AG as well as Bausparkasse der öster- reichischen Sparkassen AG and all Austrian savings banks form this cross-guarant ee system. Based on the cross-guarantee contrac t these entities are included as subsidiaries in Erste Group´s regulatory scope of consolidation. Furthermore, Erste Group Bank AG together with the Haftungsverbun d entities form an institutional protection scheme (IPS) ac- cording to Art. 113 para 7 CRR. Disclosure requirements for the institutional protection scheme according to Art. 113 para 7 e CRR are met by the publication of th e consolidated financial statements, which cover all entities included in the institutional pro tection scheme. Consolidated own funds Own funds according to CRR consist of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) , Additional Tier 1 (AT1) and Tier 2 (T2). In order to deter- mine the capital ratios, each re spective capital component – after application of all regulatory deductions and filters – is co nsidered in relation to the total risk amount. The items of own funds as disclosed are al so used for internal capital management pu rposes, except AT1 and T2 capital instrumen ts. Erste Group fulfilled the ca pital requirements througho ut the reporting period. Beside the regulatory minimum ca pital ratios also capital buffers according to ABA and regulations of the Financial Market Auth ority (FMA) need to be considered. In addition to minimum capital ratios an d capital buffer requirements, institutions also have to fulfil capital requirements de termined in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Pr ocess (SREP). As a result of the 2023 SREP process performed by the European Central Bank (ECB) Erste Group applies a Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) of 1. 90% as of 31 December 2024. Following the SREP 2023, Erste Grou p is expected to meet a Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G ) of 1.0% with CET1, valid as of 1 January 202 4 onwards."

By providing a comprehensive ESG risk assessment, Erste Group can de termine how certain ESG factors may have a positive or negative impact on the financial perfor mance of clients. The questionnaire enables the group to identify clients’ ESG risks or opportunities. Particular questions in the questionnaire may also require an in-depth assessment to un derstand the nature and severity of the ESG risks to which the client is exposed. The questionnaire forms an integral part of th e credit application and is updated at leas t annually, allowing Erste Group to understa nd the client's business model in the context of carbon transition.

Furthermore, ESG relevant data is collected for certain types of collateral, as defined in the Group Collateral Management Poli cy for real estate collateral va luations, documentation and reportin g purposes. Environmental aspects which affect the value of the co llat- eral have to be included in the real esta te valuations, which can lead to a higher or lower valuation result. Moreover, any ris ks arising from social (e.g., location and transporta tion, mass urbanisation – being indicators for easy accessibility for people) and gov ernance factors (such as improper business practices such as tax fraud or bribery of the financed company being the owner of the buildi ng serving as collateral) have to be considered as well. For commer cial real estate assets, the qu estionnaire additionally include s an assessment of the building’s environmental footprint, including information on land consumption, space efficiency, and the exis tence of a sustainable building certificate. Simi larly to large corporate lending, the bank has introduced additional lending guidanc e for commercial real estate financin g, tied to the carbon footprint of the financed asset. With regards to credit risk meas urement and internal models a re spective project to define and collect relevant climate risk dr ivers for all rating systems has started in 2022 to ensure the explicit consideration of climate risks in future model development in itiatives. In 2024, ESG factors are consider ed in the soft facts assessment in the corporate rating models. In case of sovereigns and bank s, the rating is overridden based on the ESG score derived from availa ble sources World Bank / OECD an d Bloomberg, respectively. More- over, if it is concluded that calculated model rating does not reflect the ESG risk properly, th en rating can be overridden man ually based on ESG assessment questionna ire. For the LGD models, climate risk is indirectly reflected via the collateral value. Addit ionally, within each new model development, testing of the ESG drivers is obligatory and wh ere it is deemed relevant, the respective inf or- mation needs to be integrated via model into ECL measurement. For the assessment and management of physical risks, Erste Group uses Munich Re’s Location Risk Intelligence. In 2023 the group has conducted a physical risks materiality assessment together with the University of Graz to identify key hazards and climate change scenarios relevant for its collateral po rtfolio. The results of the assessment, highlighting the importance of river flood, fire weather stress, drought stre ss, sea level rise and heat stress, is integrated into the collateral managem ent, incorporating an intermediate cli- mate change scenario of 2-3C by 2100 (Representative Concentrat ion Pathway 4.5 / Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2, developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) as a reasonable assumption.

In case of the existence of very high physical risks of a location, the collateral value would be negatively affected. To assess the potential impact of physical risk, the internal stress test incorporated an internally developed physical risk mo del. The risk ‘river flood’ was determined to be th e most relevant risk for Erste Group applying the climate hazard scores provided by M unich Re on EGBs collaterals. Among the industries presente d in the table ‘Credit risk exposu re by industry and risk category’ below in this chapter, Erste G roup identified, as part of the strategic climate initiative for the Net Zero Banking Alliance, certai n carbon-intensive sectors as important levers for setting interim emission targe ts for 2030, thereby supporting the migration of ‘Transition Risk’ in Erste Group fina nced portfolio. Targets are set for the following sectors: housing mo rtgages, commercial real estate, electricity production, heat a nd steam production, cement production, auto manufacturing, oil and gas upstream, iron and steel. During 2024 significant strides in transition risk management have been made, especially in scenario analysis and materiality a ssess- ment. An internal Transition Risk Stress Te st was conducted with focus on four scenario analysis based on NGFS (Network for Gre en- ing the Financial System) scenarios: ‘Net Zero 2050’, ’Delayed Tr ansition‘, ‘Below 2°C’ and ‘Curre nt Policies’.

Credit approval considers individual informat ion on the creditworthiness of the customer, the ty pe of credit, collateral, covenant packa ge and other risk mitigation factors involv ed. The assessment of credit default risk within Erste Group is based on the customer’s pr obability of default (PD). For each credi t exposure and lending decision, Erste Group a ssigns an internal rating, which is a uniq ue measure of the credit default risk. Th e internal rating of each customer is update d event-specific, however, at least once a year (annual rating review). Ratings of wo rkout customers are reviewed with a higher frequency. The main purpose of the internal ratings is to support the decision-making for lendin g and for the terms of credit facilities. Internal ratings also determine the level of credit approval authority within Erste Group and th e monitoring procedures for existing exp osures. At a quantitative level, intern al ratings influence the level of required risk pricing, loss allowances and, where applicable, risk- weighted assets under Pillar 1 and 2. For entities of Erste Group that use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, inte rnal ratings are key input for the risk-wei ghted assets calculation. They are also used in the group’s assessment of the economic ca pital requirements according to Pillar 2 and in other relevant model use areas. For these purposes, a distinct PD value is assigned to each rating grade for its IRB portfolios within a calibration process that is performed indivi dually for each rating method. PD values reflect a 12-month probability of default based on long-term average default rates per rati ng grade. The bank assigns margins of conservatism to the calculated PDs. Internal ratings consider all available significant information for the assessment of credit defa ult risk. For non-retail borro wers, in- ternal ratings take into account the financial strength of the counterparty, the possibility of external support , flexibility i n corporate financing, general company information and ex ternal credit history information, where av ailable. For retail clients, internal r atings are based mainly on payment behaviour versus the bank and, wher e applicable, credit bureau info rmation, supplemented with in- formation provided by the respective client and general demograp hic information. Rating ceiling rules on credit quality are app lied based on membership in a group of economic ally related entities and the country of ma in economic activity (applicable to cross- border financing facilities).

Model development follo ws an internal group-wide methodological standard and utilises relevant data covering th e respective market. In this way, Erste Group ensures the availability of rati ng models with the best possible prediction and discriminatory ability across its core regions. The central Model Validation department is responsible for defini ng the validation methodologies and standards to be applied to all credit risk models within Erste Group as well as for conducting the validation activities across the whol e Erste Group. All Pil lar 1, material Pillar 2 and IFRS9 models are subj ect to an annual validation, while for no n-material Pillar 2 and IFRS9 models a regu lar validation cycle is implemented. Model Vali dation employs qualitative as well as quanti tative validation methods to challenge c on- ceptual soundness, performance, and model us e aspects. The validation outcomes are appr oved by the respective model committees and, in case of IRB models, shared with th e regulatory bodies. In addition to the va lidation process, the group applies a regul ar monitoring process on the performance of IRB models, reflecting developments in new defaults and early delinquencies. Approvals of all new models, model changes, changes to risk parameters, changes in gr oup-wide methodologic al standards and othe r model-related aspects are following a dual approval process with in the Group – corresponding Ho lding and local model committee structures reflect joint resp onsibilities for decisions on Pillar 1 IRB and Pill ar 2 credit risk models as well as on methodolo gies related to IFRS9 parameters. Responsibilities are assigned depending on model perimeter (group-wide or locally developed model). In thi s context, the following committees are established: Strategic Ri sk Executive Committee and Strategic Risk Management Committee. Ultimate responsibility for all models used within the Group (at consolidat ed level) lies with the Group CRO. CREDIT RISK CLASSIFICATION For the disclosure of asset qu ality Erste Group assigns each customer to on e of the following four risk categories: Low risk.

Responsibilities are assigned depending on model perimeter (group-wide or locally developed model). In thi s context, the following committees are established: Strategic Ri sk Executive Committee and Strategic Risk Management Committee. Ultimate responsibility for all models used within the Group (at consolidat ed level) lies with the Group CRO. CREDIT RISK CLASSIFICATION For the disclosure of asset qu ality Erste Group assigns each customer to on e of the following four risk categories: Low risk. Typically, regional customers with well- established and rather long-standing rela tionships with Erste Group or large in- ternationally recognised customers. Very good to satisfactory financial position and lo w likelihood of financial difficulties r elative to the respective market in which the customers operate. Retail clients having long rela tionships with the bank, or clients with a wide product pool use. No relevant late paymen ts currently or in the most recent 12 months. New business is generally done with clie nts in this risk category. Management attention. Vulnerable non-retail clients, who may have overdu e payments or defaults in th eir credit history or may encounter debt repayment difficulties in the medium term. Retail clients with possible payment problems in the past triggering early collection reminders. These clients typica lly have a good recent payment history."

In some cases, restructu ring measures are possible or already in place. As a rule, such loans are managed i n special- ised risk management departments. Non-performing. One or more of the default criteria under Article 178 of the CRR are met, which include full repayment unlikely, interest or principal payments on a material exposure more than 90 days past due, restructuring re sulting in a loss to the lend er, realisation of a loan loss, or initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Erste Group appl ies the customer view for all customer seg ments, including retail clients; if an obligor defaults on one deal, then the customer’s performing transactions are classified as non -perform- ing as well. All non-performing exposures are also defaulted. The materiality of 90 days past due credit ob ligation is applied for on-balance exposure at client level and assessed daily aga inst the group-wide defined materialit y threshold (except the local regulator ha s defined different thresholds) for the: — retail exposure: as an absolute li mit on client level of 100 EUR an d relative 1% on client level; — non-retail exposure: as an absolute limit on client level of 500 EUR and relati ve 1% on client level. Based on the calibration of internal PDs (p robabilities of default) for regulatory pu rposes to the default rates published by r ating agencies, the equivalent external customer rating is used for th e assignment to risk categories. For the agency ratings, averag e one- year default rates resulting from lo ng-term time series are applied. CREDIT RISK REVIEW AND MONITORING Retail Risk Management as well as Credit Risk Portfolio in cooperation with Corporat e Risk Management conduct periodical review s of the loan portfolio for each local entity to ensure an adequa te portfolio quality and to monitor the compliance of local port folios with the principles and parameters as stipula ted by Erste Group’s credit risk policies. All credit limits and the transactions booked within the limits are review ed at least once a year. Counterparty credit risk lim its are monitored daily in an internal limit management system with remedial actions taken in case limits are exceeded. A group-wide standardised early warning monitoring process is implemented to proactively identify negative developments. The early warning monitoring process for corporate clients is managed at group level by Credit Risk Portfolio and, at subsidiary le vel, by the local units responsible for corporate ri sk management, retail risk management and collections, for respective segments.

In retail risk management, the early warning signals for adverse portfolio developments include, for instance, quality deterioration in ne w business or a decreasing collections effectiveness a nd re- quire appropriate countermeasures. Additionally, the monitoring is performed for clients where early warning signals have been identified, even if they are still fulfilling their contractual repayment obligations. Adverse portfolio developments regarding the non-performing and substandard loans portfolio of Erste Group are monitored, dis- cussed, and reported regularly. In case of further negative de velopments clients are managed in specialized workout units aimin g to maximise recoveries. 35. Credit risk exposure Credit risk exposure relates to the sum of the following balance sheet items: — cash and cash balances - demand deposits to credit institutions; — instruments (derivatives and debt se curities) held for trading (HfT); — non-trading debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); — debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); — debt instruments at amortised cost (AC), ot her than trade and other receivables; — trade and other receivables (for disclosure purposes in the tabular summaries below, an y contract assets are also included in t his category); — finance lease receivables; — debt instruments held for sa le in disposal groups; — positive fair value of hed ge accounting derivatives; — off-balance sheet exposures (primarily financia l guarantees and undrawn loan commitments)."

Th e Group Collateral Management Policy Part 1 Credit Collateral defi nes, among other topics, uniform valuation standards for credit collateral across the entire group. It ensure s that the credit risk decision processe s are standardised with respect to accepte d collateral values. All collateral types acceptable within the group are contained in the Group Collateral Catalogue. Locally permitted collateral is de- fined by the respective bank in accordance with applicable na tional legal provisions. The valuation and revaluation of collater al is done according to the principles defined in the Group Collateral Catalogue broken down by collateral type and based on the inte rnal work instructions in accordance with the in dividual supervisory requirements. Whether a type of collateral or a specific collat eral asset is accepted for credit risk mitigati on is decided by Enterprise-wide Risk Mana gement after determining if the applicable regu- latory requirements are met. Credit underw riting monitors adherence to the standard processes stipulated for assigning the acce pta- ble collateral assets to the categories available. Main types of credit collateral Mostly, the following types of credit collateral are accepted: — real estate: reside ntial and commercial real estate; — financial collateral: secu rities, cash deposits and life insurance policies; — guarantees: given by sovereigns, public sector entities, financ ial institutes, companies, and pr ivate individuals. All guaranto rs must have a minimum credit rating, which is reviewed annually; — movables: equipment, investment goods, machinery, and motor vehicles; — claims and rights: trade account receivables, leas ehold rights and shares in a company’s capital. Collateral valuation and management Collateral valuation is based on current market prices while cons idering an amount that can be recovered within a reasonable pe riod. The valuation processes are defined, and their IT-supported tech nical application is performed by Collateral Management at grou p level and by authorised staff in each coun try with the assistance of software applic ations. The allocated collateral values are capped by the amount of the secured transaction. Real estate valuation may only be performe d by qualified valuators who are independent of the credit decision process. The valu ation is to be made according to international, European, or nation al standards and has to follow va luation methods de fined by the ba nk. Internal guidelines define criteria of qu alification and requirements of independence for the selection of valuators. A valuato r may only perform two sequential valuations of the same asset, any further valuation has to result in the rotation of the valuator.

The valuation discounts are adjusted regularly – at least on ce a year – to reflect the recoveries under consideration of foreseea ble developments (like expected real estate price changes). The revaluation of collateral is done periodically and is automated as far as possible. In the case of external data sources, t he appro- priate interfaces are used. The maximum periods for the revaluat ion of individual collateral a ssets are predefined and complian ce is monitored by risk management using software applications. Apart from periodic revaluat ions, collateral is assessed when informa tion becomes available that indicates a decrease in the value of th e collateral for exceptional reasons, or when defined triggers ar e exceeded.

Treasury collateral The department Trading Book Risk Management is responsible for treasury collateral. The Group Collateral Management Policy Part 2 defines, among other things, uniform valuation standar ds for treasury collateral across the entire group. Under the framework of treasury collateral, netting agreements (i nternational framework agreements for derivatives of the Inter na- tional Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA), Austrian or Ge rman framework agreements, fram ework agreements for securities lending transactions and repurchase deals) as well as collateral agreements (e.g., ISDA Credit Support Annex) are used for redu cing the credit risk from derivatives. Netting agreements make it possible to net all amounts due or payable for each indivi dual transaction under a framework agreeme nt in the case of a credit default, with th e result that only the net re ceivables vis-à-vis the busine ss partner are of relevance for credit risk. Within the scope of these collateral agreements, the portfolio with the respective counterparty is revalued periodically, usually daily, and in case of insufficient covera ge additional collateral is requested. The policy restrictions on collateral types ens ure that collateral received predominantly consists of cash or securities of investment grade qual ity. In the case of securities used as collateral, an additional valuation discount (h aircut) depending on credit quality and residual maturity is applied.

    "text": "31737. Measurement of expected credit loss The general principles and standards for credit loss allowances ar e governed by internal policies in Erste Group. According to IFRS 9, credit loss allowances are calculated for all components of cr edit risk exposures which are measured at amortised cost (AC) or at fair value through other comprehensive inco me. They include debt securi ties, loans and advances, demand deposits on nostro ac- counts with commercial banks as well as fina nce lease and trade receivables. In additi on, credit loss allowances are calculated for loan commitments and financial guarantees if th ey meet the applicable IFRS 9 definitions. CLASSIFICATION INTO STAGES AND DEFINITION OF CREDIT-IMPAIRED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS There are three main stages outlined for expected credit loss (E CL) determination. The stages appr oach applies to financial ins tru- ments within the scope of the im pairment requirements of IFRS 9 and those that ar e not categorised as purchased or originated c redit impaired financial assets (POCI), which form a category of their own. Depending on the impairment status and the assessment of the development of credit risk, these financial instruments are assigned to one of the three stages, as described in the chapte r ‘Finan- cial instruments – Material accounting policies’, in the section ‘Impairment of financial instruments’. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK DETERMINATION Assessment of significant increase in credit risk (SICR) of financial instruments as at the reporting date since initial recogn ition is one of the key drivers affecting the amount of the ECL recognised based on IFRS 9 requirem ents. In this respect, across portfolios and product types, quantitative and qualitativ e indicators are defined for assessing SICR , including the indicator of 30 days-past- due (DPD). Erste Group methodology allows intr oduction of the cure periods for migrations back to Stage 1 from Stage 2 in addition to thos e already established in general credit risk practices (forbearan ce, watch lists, default). They ar e rarely applied, only in spec ific countries for specific criteria without sign ificant effect on the overall expected credit loss or Stage 2. Quantitative criteria. Quantitative SICR indicators includ e adverse changes in lifetime probab ility of default with significance being assessed by comparison to th e thresholds. The bank has establ ished thresholds for significan t increases in credit risk ba sed on both a percentage (relative) and absolute change in PD compared to initial recognition. SICR occurs for a particular financial instru- ment, when both the relative and th e absolute thresholds are breached. The relative measure is calculated as a ratio between current annu alised LT PD and annualised LT PD value on initial recognitio n, considering remaining maturity of the instr ument. Cumulative LT PD comparison can be used for simplification according to Erste Group methodology; however, such approach is rarely used. The breach means that such ratio has reached or is higher than the established threshold. Thes e relative thresholds for SICR a ssessment are established"

    "text": "318There are certain portfolios where SICR quantitative criteria are assessed based on the ratings ra ther than PDs. Predefined rat ing notches’ downgrade leads to SICR recognit ion. These rules are applied primarily to le asing and factoring business receivables. The relative thresholds are kept stable as one of the most significant estimates in ECL measurement. They are re-estimated due to either significant change of PD models or internal validation finding. In 2024, thresholds we re recalibrated due to PD model update: — in Austria, in case of local retail models, le ading to ECL release of EUR 4.3 million, and; — in Erste Bank Serbia, the model update cove red the review of PD and rating model. The absolute threshold refers to difference of LT PD on initial recognition and current LT PD (annualized or cumulative values) . It is set to a maximum of 50 bps and serves as a backstop for migr ations between the best ratings (L T PDs considered for remaining maturity). In such cases, relati ve thresholds may be breached, however overall LT PD is very low, and therefore SICR is not tri ggered. Qualitative criteria. Qualitative SICR indicators include forbearance-type flags (identification of regulatory forbearance), work-out transfer flags (when the account starts being monitored by the wo rk-out department), informatio n from the early-warning system and fraud indicators. The assignment of some of the qualitative indicators inherently re lies on experienced credit risk judgmen t being exercised adequately and in a timely manner. The related group-wide and entity-level credit risk controlling policies and proce dures (adapted as necessary in the light of transi tion to IFRS 9) ensure the necessary governance framework. These indicators are use d internally for identification of insolvency or increased probability that a borrower will enter bankruptcy and there is increas ed risk of default in the foreseeable future.

A backstop is applied, and the financial instruments are considered to have experienced a SICR if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on contractual payments. As observed duri ng validation, this does not represent a major trigger for Stage 2 classification. Low credit risk exemption. The ‘Low credit risk exemption’ allowed by IFRS 9 fo r ‘Investment grade’ assets or other assets deemed ‘Low risk’ (and resulting in 12 months expected credit losses bein g calculated irrespective of SI CR quantitative measures) has been implemented with limitations in Erste Group. Thus, the potential activation of this exemption is limited to particular types of debt instruments and counterparty categories, and on ly if supported by sufficient ‘Low risk ’ evidence. On this basis, the ‘Low risk exemp- tion’ is applied in special cases to debt securi ty exposures and only exceptionally to loans. As of 31 December 2024, low credit risk exemption is appl ied only to debt securities in the Czech subsidiary ( Česká spořitelna) and sovereign exposures in the Romani an subsidiary (Banca Comercial ă Română). In Česká spořitelna, the corresponding exposure amounted to EUR 17 billion (2023: EUR 16 billion) with PDs interval of 0.01%-0.5%. In Banca Comercial ă Română, the respective exposure amounted to EUR 8 billion (2023: EUR 7 billion) with PD below 0.1%. MEASURING ECL – EXPLANATION OF INPUTS AND MEASUREMENT Credit loss allowances are calculated individually or collectively. The individual calculation approach is appl ied in case of exposures to significant de faulted customers in Stage 3 or POCI. It c onsists in the individual assessment of the differe nce between the gross carrying amount and th e present value of the expected cash flo ws, which are estimated by workout or risk mana gers. The discounting of the cash flows is based on the effective interest rate (POC I: credit-adjusted effective interest rate). Ho wever, the discount rate for financial gu arantees shall reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks th at are specific to the cash flows which in Erste Group’s implem entation means using a risk-free rate as a proxy. A defaulted customer is classified as individually significant if the total on- and off-balance exposure exceeds a predefined m ateriality limit. Otherwise, the customer is considered insignificant, and a rule-based (collectiv e) approach is used for"

    "text": "319For exposures to non-defaulted customers (i.e., in Stage 1 and St age 2), collective allowances are calculated according to a ru le-based approach irrespective of the significance of the customer. The calculation of collective allowances requires grouping the relat ed ex- posures into homogenous clusters based on shared risk characteristics. The grouping criteria may differ based on the customer s eg- ment (retail, corporate) and include produc t type, collateral type, repayment type, loan to value band, and credit rating band. The calculation of credit loss allowances is done monthly on a single exposure level and in the contractual currency of the exp osure. To compute the collective credit loss allowance, Erste Group a pplies an expected credit loss (ECL) model based on a three-stage approach that leads to either a 12-month EC L or to a lifetime ECL. ECL is the discount ed product of exposure at default (EAD) t hat also includes a credit conversion factor in the case of off-balance sheet exposures, probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD), defined as follows: — PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial ob ligation (per definition of default below), either ove r next 12 months (1Y PD) for Stage 1 exposures or over the remainin g lifetime (LT PD) for Stage 2 and 3 and POCI exposures. — EAD is based on the amounts Erste Group expe cts to be owed at the time of default, over next 12 months (1Y EAD) for Stage 1 exposures, or over the remaining lifetime (LT EAD) for Stage 2 and 3 and POCI exposures. The e stimation includes current bal- ance, expected repayments, and expected drawings up to the current contractual limit by the time of default. — LGD represents the Erste Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per u nit exposure at the time of default (EAD). LIFE-TIME PARAMETERS The LT PD is developed through observation of historical defaults over an available history. The calculated LT PDs are extrapol ated, e.g., via matrix multiplication, to ensure that th e final lifetime PD covers the lifetime of the loans from initial recognition. It i s assumed to be the same across all assets in the same portfolio, rating band, and the country of risk which is an additional relevant PD chara cteristic considered via forward looking information in case of local specialized lending portfolio in Austria and central models for Gro up (Large) Corporate. The 1Y and LT EADs are determined based on the expected payment profiles, which vary by product type. The LT EAD calculation utilises repayment schedule or repayment type (annuity, linear, bullet). In the case of undrawn commitments, credit conversion factor is estimated for reflecting the expect ed credit exposure in the EAD. The LGD is estimated as a lifetime curve for"

The risk parameters used in the ECL calculation consider availa ble information at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts on future economic trends. Generally, the risk parameters ap plied in the calculation of collective al lowances differ from the risk parameters compliant wi th capital requirement regulations, calculated on a th rough-the-cycle basis, if the char- acteristics of the respective portfolio in comb ination with IFRS stand ards necessitate this. However, Erste Group harmonized the approach for modeling and se lecting the estimation sample fo r the risk parameters in 2024 i n all entities.Together with the update of LG D model and parameters regular review, it le d to the decrease of ECL in amount of EU R 54 million. Moreover, in Austria, a new CCF mo del was implemented, leading to allocati on of ECL in amount of EUR 9 million."

    "text": "327Thus, the unbiased scenario weighted ECL considering FLI is deri ved using the weights representing the outcome of each macroe- conomic scenario. Typical macroeconomic variables may include re al gross domestic prod uct, unemployment rate, inflation rate, production index as well as market interest rates. The selection of variables also depe nds on the availabili ty of reliable fore casts for the given local market. The main indicator of the estimated econ omic development and basis for alternative scenario derivation is the GDP. In addition, economic effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the emerging conflicts in the middle east came along w ith the increases of the inflation and/or the interest rates. Erste Group ad justed macro-shift models to reflect expected effects o f those into credit risk parameters. Macro-shift FLI models are recalibrated r egularly to reflect the most relevant macro- variables. The recalibration is performed by the local entities (except for the central models for Group (Large) Corpor ate) and variables with the high est statistical relevance are i ncluded. In case of central model for Group (Large) Corporates, the Group (dedicated central units) is responsible for the PD review inc luding a FLI model which is based on the country of risk distingui shing the macro development in the different countries. In 2024, the same FLI model, distinguishing the macro development in the different coun tries, has been implemented for FLI esti - mate in case of local specialized lending portfolio in Austria wh at led to ECL release in amount of EUR 24 million. Moreover, i n Austria, FLI model has been implemented for FL I estimate applied in case of LGD, leadin g to ECL allocation in amount of EUR 6 million. Erste Group reviewed the FLI in the fourth quarter of 2024 acco rding to the disclosed forecasts for baseline, downside, and ups ide scenarios . Based on the assessment of conditions (exit triggers) for a pplying in-model adjustments in FLI models (incorporation of comprehensive stress test (CST) scenario into the downside scenario and expertly set up weights for the downside and upside sce - narios), Erste Group decided: — to keep unchanged the approach of including the CST scenario, updated according to the assumptions considered in comprehen- sive stress test 2024, into th e downside scenario modelling in all local and central models, except local models applied in Austria due to risk materialization observed in 2024 (the removal of CS T scenario, based on the internal impact estimate, triggered the decrease of ECL in amount of EUR 15 million); — to apply the modelled weights for downside and upside scenarios in all entities in stead of expertly set weig hts.

The bank is disclosing sensitivity of th e staging and ECL on macro scenarios in th e ‘Collective assessment’ section below. Baseline scenario Erste Group expects the Eurozone economy to gradually recover in 2025. The main factor supporting the constructive baseline out - look for the Eurozone in 2025 is the ongoin g real wage growth which should support pr ivate consumption. In addition, further ra te cuts by the ECB as the year 2025 prog resses should lead to a gradual recovery of investment activity, which in turn should supp ort industrial production. Due to further easing of inflationary pressures, especially from services, Erste Group expects the ECB to deliver four more rat e cuts (25 bp each) in 2025. This sh ould bring the deposit rate down to 2.0% by year end 2025. RISKS TO THE BASELINE SCENARIO AND COMPREHENS IVE STRESS TEST SCENARIO AS CONSIDERATIONS ADDED TO DOWNSIDE SCENARIO The ongoing war in Ukraine, including emerging conflicts in the middle east, remains significant risk factor. In addition, the uncertainty with regard to the trade policy of the new US administration under the President Trump is a furthe r risk factor for the outlook. Substantially raises of tariffs on all im ports (the current tariff level is around 2%) would harm globa l trade and growth to a larger degree than anticipated in our base line scenario. Thus, in particular export and inve stment growth in the E urozone would be much slower in 2025 and 2026 th an currently forecasted by Erste Group. Security of energy supplies remains an issue for the EU, consider ing the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The EU is rely ing to a rising degree on supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from exporters which are geographically further away such as the USA or Middle Eastern countries. Any disruptions in the global LNG trade could have severe consequences on all energy prices in the EU. Fast rising energy prices, triggered by any kind of supply disrup tions, could force the ECB to ti ghten monetary policy aggressi vely (affecting the entire yield curve) to keep inflation under control."

Temporary pre ssure on the power grid from large swings in energy supply from green energy could result in temporary price spikes for electricity w hich could harm industrial activity an d the consumers purchasing power. The fast rise of interest rates is a threat for the investment activity of compan ies and consumers. It could lead to lower inve stments than currently anticipated for our base case scenario. In general, higher Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), especiall y electricity/gas bills, reduces disposable in come and contracts consumption. Given the high debt inherited from the pandemic, in - creasing military spending and expansive fiscal policies (espec ially in France) could lead inve stors to question debt sustainab ility in some countries. UPSIDE RISK TO THE BASELINE SCENARIO In case the global industry recovers faster and stronger than it is expected in the baseline scenario, supported by lower or no additional trade measures from the new US administration, it would certainl y have an immediate positive im pact on the German economy, which is now already for two years in rece ssion. In light of the tight interconnectio ns between Germany and other major countri es of the Eurozone, a stronger and faster recovery of German industry would also have an immediate positive impact on the entire industry of the Eurozone. A faster and stronger recovery of Europe an industry would give certainly a positive boost to GDP grow th in 2025 and 2026, as the recovery of investment activity would ta ke hold faster and stronger than currently expected in our bas eline scenario. We would expect in this scenario that the co nsumer sentiment would also be impacted positively. Therefore, private consumption would have a bigger contribution to growth in 2025 and 2026, when comparing to our baseline sce- nario. The services sector of the economy would benefit from a better and higher cons umer sentiment as well. However, a further gradual easing of inflationary pressure (e specially in the services sector) is mandat ory in this scenario in order not to endan ger ex- pected rate cuts by the ECB in 2025.

This approach is aligned with all affe cted entities and business lines and approved by the respective governance bodies of Erste Group. It requires, after the assessment of the outliers from the common portfolio characte ristics, to have exemptions from the colle ctive SICR assessment, if properly documen ted why they would behave differently than the rest of the portfolio. In December 2024, Erste Group applied colle ctive staging assessment for specific indu stries. The collective staging assessment in case of cyclical industries applied in December 2023, identified based on the correlation to economic do wnturn in case of selected i ndus- tries from energy sector (production & distribution of energy and heating), including energy in tensive industries (Metals and C hem- icals), were removed (energy stage overlays ) or transformed (cyclical stage overlays): — the energy stage overlays due to the distortions in the energy m arket with implications on gas/energy availability and price. I n June 2024, energy stage overlays were decomm issioned based on the regular evaluation of the conditions (exit triggers) for appl y- ing of collective SICR assessment.

Pers istent high inflation and dilution of disp osable income continues to dampen privat e consumption, while the high global uncertainty and high refinanc ing conditions have adverse effe cts on investment and industria l activity. While some industries developed bett er in 2023, confirmed by rating reviewed in 2024, others are still facing high in ven- tories, continuing supply chain i ssues and cost inflation and additionally lower demand. The latter is not yet reflected in cli ents' financials, and still a ratings' downshifts are expected. Therefore, in November 2024, the cyclical stage overlays were trans- formed/re-assessed to ensure the better connection of overlays with internal risk management pr ocesses. The new overlays (in- dustry stage overlays) connect collective SICR assessment with industry strategy, that reflects risks and changes in the risk assessment which our portfolio is exposed to, instead of general definition of cyclical industr ies used before.

In November 2024, it led to ECL release in amount of EUR 38 million. Out of the overall credit risk exposure of EUR 399 billion (2 023: EUR 364 billion), portfolio un der collective staging assessme nt (industry stage overlays) represents EUR 76 bill ion, thereof EUR 18 billion is in Stage 2 (out of which EUR 7 billion due to ap plying rules for industry stage overlays). In 2022, local risk management in Czechia an d Croatia assessed that the re calibration of private individuals’ macro shift FLI m odel did not bring feasible results and does not sufficiently address current situation. Therefore, the additional SICR collective a ssessment on Private individual side was introduced and is still in place. It triggers additional stage 2 exposure of EUR 1 billion as of 31 Decem- ber 2024 and increase of allocated ECL by EUR 21 million. In September 2024, because of floods in parts of central Europe , new SICR collective assessment ru les were introduced in Czechi a to cover the physical risk. It triggered additi onal Stage 2 exposure of EUR 2 billion as of 31 December 2024 and the increase of a llocated ECL by EUR 15 million.

Additional se nsitivities to the baseline, upside and do wnside scenarios are simulated. Effects o n geo- graphical segments are disclosed. In December 2024, the exposure in Stage 2 due to the application of the rules for collective SICR assessment (industry stage ov erlays) stood at EUR 6,559 million (2023: EUR 10,232 million due to cyclical industries and EUR 6,525 million due to energy industries) , with additional ECL allocated in the am ount of EUR 122 million (2023: EUR 195 million due to cyclical industries and EUR 49 million due to energy industries).

The downside scenario would lead to addition al EUR 5,281 million (2023: EUR 2,402 milli on) of exposure migration to Stage 2 in comparison with scenario weighted FL I, resulting in ECL increase of EUR 383 million (2023: EUR 207 million).

Restructuring, renegotiation and forbearance Restructuring means contractual modification of any of the custo mer’s loan repayment conditions including tenor, interest rate, fees, principal amount due or a combination thereof. Forbearance can be initiated by the bank or by the customer (on account of loss of employment, illness etc.). Components of forbearance can be insta lment reduction, tenor extensio n, interest reduction or forgiv eness, principal reduction or forgiveness, revolving exposure change to instalment and/or others. A restructuring is considered ‘forbearance’ if it entails a conc ession towards a customer facing or about to face financial dif ficulties in meeting their contractual financial commitments. A borrower is in financial difficulties if an y of the following conditions are met: — the customer was more than 30 da ys past due in the past 3 months; — the customer would be 30 days past due or more without receiving forbearance;"

Non-performing credit risk exposure and credit loss allowances For the definition of credit risk exposure classified as non-performing, please refer to the description of risk categories in the subsection ‘Credit risk classification’. Credit risk allowances include credit loss allowances for financial assets, credit loss allowance s for loan commitments and financial guarantees (all allowances within the scope of IFRS 9) and provisions for other commitments. Credit loss allowances (all stages combined) covered 78% (2023: 90% ) of the reported non-performi ng on-balance and off-balance credit risk exposure. During 2024, the non-performing credit risk exposure increased by EUR 881 million, or 17%, as well as the credit loss allowance s for loans and advances together with credit loss allowances for loan commitments and financial guarantees slightly increased by EUR 95 million or 2%. This development resulted in a moderate decrease of 11 percentage points in the coverage of non-performing cr edit risk exposure by credit risk allowances. The following tables show the coverage of the non-performing credit risk exposure by credit loss allowances (without taking int o consideration collateral). The differences in the credit allowanc e levels between the reporting segments result from the risk s ituation in the respective markets, diffe rent levels of collateralisation as well as the local legal environment and regulatory requirem ents. The non-performing exposure ratio (NPE ratio) is calculated as the non-performing credit risk ex posure divided by total credit risk exposure while the NPE coverage ratio is comp uted as total credit loss allowances (all allowances within the scope of IFRS 9) d ivided by non-performing credit risk exposure at AC and FVOCI. Collateral is not considered in the NPE coverage ratio."

At Erste Group, market risk is divided in to interest rate risk; credit spread risk, currency risk, equity risk, commodity risk, and vola- tility risk. This concerns both tr ading and banking book positions. METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED At Erste Group, potential losses that may ari se from market movements are assessed usin g the value at risk (VaR) methodology. T he VaR describes what level of losse s may be expected as a maximum at a defined pr obability – the confidence level – within a cert ain holding period of the positions under historically observed market conditions. The VaR calculation for the trading book is based on the methodol ogy of historical simulation with a one-sided confidence level of 99%, a holding period of one day, and a look back period of two years. Back-testing for the trading book is used to constantly monitor th e validity of the internal mark et risk model. This process is con- ducted with a one-day delay to monitor if the model projections regarding losses have actually materialised. At a confidence le vel of 99%, the actual loss on a given day should exceed the VaR estimate statistically only tw o to three times a year (1% of around 2 50 workdays). The VaR calculation for banking book positions (BB-VaR) is base d on the methodology used for IC AAP calculation of Erste Group where 250.000 historical scenarios (starting wi th 2010) are calculated with a theoretica l holding period of 1 year and a confid ence level of 99.90%. The same calculation is used for the BB-VaR wi th a 1 day holding period and a 99% confidence level, consistent with the trading book methodology. The results of both calculations, ICAAP and BB-VaR ar e presented in the Group ALCO to the man- agement board. A known limitation of the VaR approach is that on the one hand, it estimates losses only up to th e confidence level, and on the other hand, the model considers only those market scenarios observed wi thin the look-back period to calculate the VaR for the cur-ren t"

These stress te sts are designed to cover market mo vements of low probability and hig h impact. The stress tests are carried out according to several methods: for the trading book, a stressed VaR (SVaR) is derived from the normal VaR calculation. Instead of simulating only over the two most rece nt years, an analysis of a much longer period is carried out to identify a one-year period that constitutes a relevant period of stress for the current portfolio mix. According to the regulat ory frame- work, that one-year stressed period is used to calculate a VaR wi th a 99% confidence level. This enables Erste Group to hold su fficient own funds available for the trading book even in periods of elevat ed market volatility, while also enabling it to incorporate t hese resulting effects into the mana gement of trading positions. Standard scenarios are also defined, in which selected market ri sk factors are subject to extrem e movements. Such scenarios are calculated at Erste Group for interest rate s, stock prices, exchange rates and volati lities. Historic scenarios are a modificat ion of the concept of standard scenarios. In this case , risk factor movements modelled after cert ain crisis events such as ‘Covid-19 crisi s’ or ‘Lehman bankruptcy’ form the basis of the stress calculation. In addition, hypothetical stress test scenarios are defined based on analysis of the current economic environment and projections of adverse developments of key market risk drivers. These analyses are made available to the Market Risk Committee within the scope of the regular market risk repo rting. Banking book positions a re considered in the comp rehensive stress test. METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS OF RISK MITIGATION At Erste Group, market risks are controlled in the trading book by setting several layers of limits. The overall limit based on risk- weighted assets (RWAs) for the trading book is allocated by the management board in the Risk Appetite Statement while consideri ng the risk-bearing capacity and projected earn ings. A further breakdown in VaR, SVaR, an d sensitivity limits is done by the Marke t Risk Committee on the basis of a proposal from the Trading Book Risk Management unit. All market risk activities of the trading book are assigned risk limits which are en tirely consistent with the overall RWA limi t. The RWA limit is broken down into dedicated VaR and SVaR limits and assigned in a top-down procedur e to the individual trading unit s. Additionally, in a bottom-up procedure, sens itivity limits are assigned on trading desk level to control exposures to individua l risk drivers and ensure sufficient diversificatio n. These are then aggregated and applied as a second-limit layer to the VaR and SVa R limits. Limit compliance is verified at two levels : by the appropriate local"

Trading book VaR and SVaR are calculated da ily at group level and reported to all key stakeholders including the relevant board members. In case of a limit breach, th e escalation procedure ensu res the timely remediatio n of the limit breach. In Banking Book, limits are implemented top-down from Group to individual entity covering change in economic value and in net interest income as well as limits on market risk Pillar 2 RWA. Limit monitoring is do ne by respective local risk management and Group Banking Book Risk Management. Dedicated escalation procedure is in place in case of limit breaches.

    "text": "343As of year-end 2024 the number of VaR backte sting outliers is zero in the trading book and hence the regula tory multiplier has a value of 3.0. This is marginally lower comp ared to the one outlier at year-end 2023. The internal model reacted to the increase d levels of volatility observed on the market and the overall level of VaR figures increased. The postpon ed implementation of the new re gu- latory framework for market risk under the CRR3 to 2026 means th at the internal model will be us ed also in 2025. Increase in Va R figure for Banking Book increased due to higher investments on a sset side and methodological upda tes performed in course of clo sing OSI findings related to IRRBB (loan commitment in clusion, loan and deposit model recalibration). Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) Interest rate risk is the current and prospective risk of a negative impact to th e institution’s economic value of equity, or t o the insti- tution’s net interest income, taki ng market value changes into a ccount as appropriate, which arise from adverse movements in in ter- est rates affecting interest rate sensitive instruments, including gap risk, basis risk and option risk. To identify interest rate risk, all financ ial instruments, including off-balance instruments are used to calculate the impact o f certain interest rate scenarios on their economic value and their net interest in come. Limits and thresholds are implemented for both a spects of the IRRBB, the change in economic value as well as the change in net interest income. Positions without contractually define d maturity or repricing structures, such as demand deposits or overdrafts are modelled accordingly. For positions where the custo mer has the right to prepay his debt prepayment models are applied. During 2024 Erste Group has updated its behavioural models according to the intern al Model Risk Management policy and regulator y expectations. Among others, this update co mprises extension of data histories, includ ing now the recent developments of interes t rates, and extending the models granularity to reflect account specific features. For internal risk calculations and for the regulatory interest rate risk measur es, the maximum downward shock is floored accord ing to the Article 4 (k) of the EBA Regulatory Technical Standard on the supervisory outlier tests (EBA/RTS/2022/10) and the Articl e 3 (7) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/856. With in creasing yield curves, especially in EUR, USD and CZK, these embedded floors have become less relevant. For calculating IRRBB measures there is ongoing effort to migrat e all relevant Erste Group entities to new BRiTA data infrastru cture. During 2024, CSAS was successfully migrated to BRiTA.

Exchange rate risk Risk from open foreign exchange positions is the risk related to exchange rates that derives from the mism atch between assets a nd liabilities, or from currency-related financial derivatives. In the trading book, these risks mi ght originate from customer-rel ated or trading operations and are monitored and managed daily. Foreign cu rrency exposure is subject to regulatory and internal limits. The internal limits for the trading book ar e set by the Market Risk Committee. Erste Group separately measures and manages other types of risks relating to the grou p’s balance sheet and earnings structure. The translation risk related to the valuat ion of the balance sheet items, earnings, dividends and participations/net investment s in local currency or foreign exchange has an im pact on consolidated earnings and consolidated capital. Erste Group is also reducin g the negative impact related to volatility of foreign exchange rates on asset performance (f or example because of foreign exchange l ending in the CEE countries that was stopped for clients not having sufficient regular inco me in the respective loan currency). In order to manage its multi-currency earn ings structure, Erste Group regularly discu sses hedging opportunit ies and takes decis ions in the Group Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) . Asset and Liability Management (ALM) uses as the usual source of information the current financial results and the financial bu dget prepared for the upcoming period to obtain as much information as possible o n the future foreign currency cash fl ows. The proposal, which mainly includes the volume, hedging level, hedge ratio and timeline of the hedging, is submitted by ALM to ALCO. The impact of translation on consolidated capital is monitored and reported to ALCO.

Erste Group is exposed to credit spread risk with respect to its securitie s portfolio, both in the trading as well as in the banking book. For the trading book, credit spread risk fo r government bonds is part of the general market risk covered by VaR and SVaR. Corpo rate bonds are allocated to benchmark spread curv es depending on sector, rating, and currency as part of the general risk covered by VaR and SVaR. The issuer specific risk is cove red by the standardised approach for Pillar 1 of regulatory capi tal requirements. For the issuer specific risk of the trading book in Pillar 2, the spread risk is broken down into a systematic and a residual part risk and report- ed on an aggregated level. Quantifying the credit spread risk of the securities in the banking book is based on a historical simulation. The maximum (hypo thet- ical) drawdown that can be attributed to credit related risk fa ctors over a one-year horizon is calculated. It is based on cred it spread sensitivities (CR01) and the risk factors used are mainly z-spre ads for sovereigns and corporate benchmark bond spreads for fin an- cials and corporates. The portfoli o included into the calculation comprises all bo nd measured at fair value and starting with y ear-end 2024 also bonds measured at-cost which are not eligible for central bank operations. The resulting am ount is used as part of th e ICAAP calculations to determine the Pillar 2 capital consumption of the banking book portfolio. For banking book positions, the impacts of changes in credit spreads on the economic value and net interest income are addition ally assessed through rating-dependent wi dening and narrowing shock scenari os derived from historical data.

IFRS hedge accounting is appl ied, if possible, to avoid accoun ting mismatches due to hedging activity. Within the scope of IFRS-compliant hedge accounting, fair value hedges, cash flow, and net investment hedges are used . In addition, the fair value option is used for hedging the market ri sk from the economic perspective. Most of the hedging within E rste Group concerns hedging of interest rate ri sk. The remainder is hedging of foreign ex change rate risk using net investment hedge s."

The growth in loan volume was financed by inflows of customer deposi ts and issued securities. With regards its own issuance, Er ste Group Bank AG issued EUR 4.5 billion in bond s in 2024 (2023: EUR 6.1 billion). EUR 1.4 bil lion (2023: EUR 2.7 billion) was collected by issuing senior prefer red bonds, of which EUR 750 million (2023: EUR 1.25 billion) was printed via a benchmark sized transaction. Mortgage bonds issued in amount of EUR 2.2 billion (2023: EUR 3 billion), whereby Tier 2 sub or- dinated debt issuance amounted to EUR 990 million (2023: EUR 40 0 million). This was offset by repurchases of EUR 9.2 million (2 023: EUR 49 million). The average tenor of all new issues in 2024 is approximately 7.2 years (2023: 5.5 years). Erste Group’s total TLTRO participation in 2024 decreased to zero (2023: 6.35 billion). LIQUIDITY METRICS AND REPORTS The liquidity risk in Erste Group is define d in line with the principl es set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as well as the European and Austrian regulations Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), Regula tion (EU) 2015/61 and the Council and the ‘Kreditinstitute-Risikomanagement- Verordnung - KI-RMV’ in their current versions . Accordingly, a distinction is made between market liquidity risk, which is the risk th at the group entities cannot easily offset or close a position at the market price b ecause of inadequate market depth or market disruption, and funding liquid ity risk, which is the risk that the banks in the group will no t be able to meet efficiently both expected and unexpected current an d future cash flow and collater al needs without affecting eithe r daily operations or the financial condition of the group members. Funding liquidity risk is furthe r divided into insolvency risk and structural li quidity risk. The former is the short-term risk that current or future payment obligations cannot be met in full and on time in an economically justified manner, while structural l iquid- ity risk is the long-term risk of losses due to a change in the Group’s own re financing cost or spread. The regulatory liquidity ratios LCR and NSFR are well implemented in Erste Group which uses the above-mentioned technical en-vironment to calculate the LCR according to Regulation (EU) No 2015/61 as well as the NS FR according to the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in their currently valid versions. Erste Group calculates LCR daily on solo and group level and repo rts it monthly to the authoritie s. Furthermore, the LCR is par t of the internal Risk Appetite Stat ement (RAS).

As they restrict liquidity flows bet ween Erste Group’s subsidiaries in different coun tries they are considered fo r the assessment of liquidity risk in the survival peri od model as well as in the calculation of the LCR at group level. The NSFR is calculated monthly on solo and group level and is re ported on a quarterly basis to the authorities. Same as the LCR , the NSFR is part of the internal RAS and limits are defined in the RAS targeting to be well above the regulatory requirement of 100 %. Short-term insolvency risk is monitored by calculating the survival period analysis (SPA) on both entity and group levels. This analysis determines the maximum period during which the entity can survive a set of defined sc enarios, including a severe combined marke t and idiosyncratic crisis while relying on it s pool of liquid assets. The monitored wo rst-case scenario simulates very limited m oney market and capital market access and at the same time significan t client deposit outflows. Furthe rmore, the simulation assumes increased drawdown on guarantees and loan commitments dependent on the type of customer, as well as the potential out-flows from collateralised derivative transactions estimating the effect of co llateral outflows in the case of adverse market movement s. The SPA is covering a stress horizon of up to 12 months. It is calculated monthly at entity and group level. Structural liquidity is monitored with the internal Structural Liquidity Ratio (STRL), depicting the going concern maturity mis - matches of the subsidiaries and the group. The STRL is calcul ated monthly both on solo entity level and on group level. All above mentioned reports (LCR, NSFR, SPA and STRL) are report ed to the Operational Liquidity Committee (OLC) as well as to the management board during the Group ALCO. Additionally, concentration risks in the fu nding structure and ‘Counterbalancing Capa city’ (CBC) are regularly monitored and re - ported to the regulator.

    "text": "346METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS OF RISK MITIGATION Apart from the reporting of liquidity me trics to the OLC and the Group ALCO, anot her important instrument for managing the liquidity risk within Erste Group and in re lation to its subsidiaries is the FTP sy stem. Important information for liquidity ma nage- ment can be obtained by the process of planning funding needs. Therefore, a detailed overview of funding needs is prepared on a quarterly basis for the planning horizon across Erste Group. The Comprehensive Contingency Plan of the Erste Group ensures the necessary coordination of all p arties involved in the liquidi ty management process in case of crisis and is reviewed on a regu lar basis. The contingency plans of the subsidiaries are coordina ted as part of the plan for Erste Group. ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY RISK In Erste Group, the liquidity risk is analysed by the following methods. Liquidity coverage ratio. Erste Group uses the regulatory LC R for internal monitoring and steer ing of the liquidity position. To keep the LCR according LCR DA above both li mits, the regulatory limit and the internal limit, Erste Group closely monitors its short- term liquidity inflows and outflo ws as well as its available coun terbalancing capacity (CBC). Erste Group’s LCR continues to stay stable at a high level despite TLTRO repayments throughout 2024, Erste Group actively manag es to keep high liquidity buffer. Thus, Erste Group is having a more than comfortable buffer well abov e internal and external limits. Liquidity coverage ratio in EUR million Dec 23 Dec 24 Liquidity buffer 81843 79810 Net liquidity outflow 53356 52642 Liquidity coverage ratio 1534% 1516% Structural liquidity gaps. The long-term liquidity position is managed using structural liquidity gaps based on contractual and partially behavioural cash flows of all liquidity relevant comp onents of the balance sheet (on-balance and off-balance). This l iquidity position is calculated fo r each material currency. Cash flows are broken down by contractual maturities in accordance with the amortisa tion schedule and arran ged in maturity rang es. All customer products without contractual matu rities (such as demand deposits and over drafts) are included according to a going concern maturity profile using model based on statistically observed client behaviour. The increased liquidity gap within the first- year time band was driven mostly by an update of the demand deposit model due to c ustomer behaviour (mainly coming from two subsidiaries). Deposits are now distributed over longer time horizons based on the observed c lient behaviour, which results into an increase of the gap in the first year whereby the gap in the last year time band decreases in comparison to last year.

Counterbalancing capacity. Erste Group regularly monitors i ts counterbalancing capacity, whic h consists of cash, excess minimum reserves at the central banks as well as unencumbered central ba nk eligible assets and other liqu id securities, including impac ts from repos, reverse repos, and securities lendin g transactions. These assets can be mobilise d in the short term to offset potential cash out- flows in a crisis situation."

Operational risk In line with point (52) of Article 4(1) of regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), Erste Gr oup defines Operational Risk (OpRisk) as risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from exte rnal events, including, but not limited to, legal risk, model risk or information and communication technology (ICT) risk, bu t excluding strategic and reputational ris k. Non-Financial Risks (NFR) comprise both operational and reputational risks. Erste Group’s operational ri sk appetite sets the li mits and escalation levels in line with the gr oup risk strategy for risk-taking because of doing business. The OpRisk Framework is a mod- ular, interrelated, and comprehensive approach integrated into the banks and the group’s steering and risk management system. I t is designed to fulfil internal risk managemen t and external regula tory requirements."

    "text": "349ORGANISATION AND GOVERNANCE The roles and responsibilities for OpRisk management is defined by the ’Three Lines of Defence’ model. The day-to-day managemen t of operational risk is the primary respon sibility of Business Line Management (BLM). BLM is responsible for identifying, assess ing, and managing the risks residual in the products, activities, proc esses, and systems on an ongoing basis by using operational ri sk management instruments. Group Operational and Non-Financial Risk independently oversees the Group-wide management of op-erational risks, identifies and reports risks on the Group-level. The NFR function defines the NFR Framework, promotes a consis tent application across the group, develops and maintains the OpRisk capital model. Regional Operational Conduct Committee (ROCC) decides on strategic steering topics based on NFR reporting, serves as a sounding board for risk decisions concerning non-financial risks and de cides on escalations to the Ho lding Board of Erste Group. NON-FINANCIAL RISK FRAMEWORK AND MEASUREMENT Erste Group implemented Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) in 2009 and uses partially Basic Indicator Approach (BIA). The OpRisk Framework consists of various el ements in the AMA. Risk identification ta kes place through the collection of interna l loss data and Key Risk Indicators (KRI) to measure the risk le vel changes. Risk indicators are reviewed periodically to ensure early detection of risk potentials to cause losses. The risk identifica tion process includes an on-goi ng mechanism to identify new su b-risk types, risk drivers and emerging risks. Risk evaluation is an ongoing process in which the Business Line Management (BLM) proac - tively identifies and analyses relevant non-financial risks and assesses the effectiveness of the controls to mitigate those ri sks, both for the run and change the bank processes (e .g., new product approval, outsourcings). BL M evaluates the risks in line with the risk appetite and reports the residual risks to senior management or risk committees for ri sk response. The acceptance level of NFR is managed by using the Group Operational Risk Scaling Matrix which is setting the limits of the resi dual operational risk tolerat ed by Erste Group. Risk monitoring via corrective measures is performe d on a regular basis. Regular ri sk reporting provides detailed infor- mation to business and risk management uni ts, senior management and the board of di rectors, most importantly the quarterly Grou p Risk Re-port, which informs on recent lo sses, loss trends, qualitative information derived from Risk Control Self-Assessments, NFR decisions, risk indicators, key ratios an d the Erste Group VaR for operational risk. Entities following Ba sic Indicator Approac h (BIA) implemented internal loss data collect ion, new product approval and outsourcing risk management instruments. Erste Group measures the regulatory and ec onomic capital requirements for operational risk using the AMA for fourteen entities and the rest of the Group uses BIA on the grou p level. The basis for calculating the BIA capital is the three-year average of the g ross income which is multiplied by a fixed rate of 15%. Pursuant to"

    "text": "353IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL It is typical of intangible assets that they do not generate ca sh inflows that are l argely independent of those from other asse ts. As a result, the impairment test is carried out at the level of the cash-generating unit (C GU) to which the asset belongs. For CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated the impairment test is carried out a nnually in November, or whenever there is an indication of poss ible impairment during the year. For CGUs at Erste Group the recoverable amount for determining th e potential impairment loss is typically based on value in use which is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. The calculation starts with estimation of future earnings distributable to shareholders. In this respect financial plans for the CGUs as agreed by the management while t aking into account the fulfilment of the respecti ve regulatory capital requirements are used. The planning period is five years. Any fore- casted earnings beyond the planning period are derived on the basis of the last year of the planning period and a long-term gro wth rate. The present value of such perpetual earnings growing at a stable rate (referred to as term inal value) takes into consider ation macroeconomic parameters and economically sustainable cash flows for each CGU. The cash flows are determined by subtracting the annual capital requirement generated by a change in the amount of risk-weighte d assets from the estimated future earnings. The capital requirement was de fined through the target tier 1 ratio in light of the expected future minimum regulatory capital requirements. The discount rates reflect risks specific to the CGU and have b een determined based on the capi tal asset pricing model (CAPM). According to the CAPM, the discount rate co mprises a risk-free interest rate together wi th a market risk premium that itself is mul- tiplied by a factor that represents the syste matic market risk (beta factor). Furtherm ore, a country-risk premium component is con- sidered in calculation of the discount rate . The values used to establish the discount rates are determined using external sour ces of information. When the recoverable amount of a CGU is le ss than its carrying amount, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss in th e statement of income under the line item ‘Other operating result’. The analysis on the recoverability of non-financial assets is ex plained in section ‘Material acco unting policies’ in the chapte r ‘Material accounting judgements, a ssumptions and estimates’."

The goodwill of Česká spořitelna a.s. (‘CSAS’) was tested for objective evidence of impairment on a quart erly basis during 2024. The annual goodwill impairment test was performe d as of 31 October 2024. With regards to the ongoing planning uncertainty caused by the unpredictable economic environment due to several global conf licts (Israel, Ukraine), Erste Gr oup derived an additional pla nning scenario for the impairment test. In addition to the base case scenario, which was weighted as the most likely scenario with 60 % probability, a downside scenario with 40% probability weighting was also defined. The recoverable amount was higher than the ca r- rying amount, thus no impairment was required. In 2023 the goodwill of Commerzbank Zrt. was impaired in the amount of EUR 9 million."

    "text": "358Leases A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the ri ght to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consi deration. 50. Erste Group as a lessor On the side of the lessor, a distinction is made between finance leases and operating leases. A finance lease is a lease that t ransfers substantially all the risks and rewards incide ntal to ownership of an asset. In the ca se of a finance lease, Erste Group report s a receivable from the lessee under the line item ‘Finance lease re ceivables’. The receivable is equal to the present value of the contrac- tually agreed payments taking into account any residual value. Interest in come on the receivable is reported in the statement o f income in the line item ‘Other simil ar income’ under ‘Net interest income’. In the case of operating leases, which are leases other than finance leases, the leased asset is reported in ‘Property and equi pment’ or in ‘Investment properties’ and is depreciate d in accordance with the principles appl icable to the assets involved. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the sta tement of income under the line item ‘Rental income from inve stment properties and other operating leases’. Erste Group is mitigating the risk associated with any rights it retains in underlying assets. This is achieved especially by m eans of residual value guarantees, variable lease payments for use in excess of specified limi ts and buy-back agreem ents with third par ties. Erste Group (intermediate lessor) accounts fo r the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The intermediate less or is required to classify the sublease as a fi nance or operating lease by reference to th e right-of-use asset ari sing from the head lease.

When determining the present value of lease payment Erste Group ty pically uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount r ate. For movables it consists of EURIBOR as a base rate, adjusted by a surcharge based on the entity’s rating, the amount of funds b or- rowed, the term of the lease and the collateral provided. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate for property leas es is based on two components, the market rate an d the single property rate. The market rate considers the lease term, creditworthine ss and the base rate EURIBOR and is derived fr om existing bank data. The single property rate represents a surcharge to the market rate based on the quality of the single property .

The balance sheet line item ‘Provisions’ includes: — provisions for defined employee benefit plan s recognised based on requirements of IAS 19 — provisions for expected credit losses from loan commitments and financial guarantees recognised based on requirements of IFRS 9 ; and — remaining classes of provisions recognised in accordance with IAS 37 such as provis ions or litigation, restructuring, commitmen ts and guarantees not in scope of IFRS 9. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES Recognition of provisions requires judgement with respect to wh ether Erste Group has a present ob ligation as a result of a past event and whether it is probable that an outflow of resources embody ing economic benefits will be requ ired to settle the obligation. Fur- thermore, estimates are necessary with respect to the amount and timing of future cash flows wh en determining the amount of provisions.

    "text": "362Jubilee provisions are special one-off payments stipulated in the collective agreement which are dependent on remuneration and duration of service. Eligibility is conditioned on a certain minimum dura tion of the employment. From IAS 19 categorisation perspective, pension and severance benefits qualify as post-employm ent defined benefits plans wherea s jubilee benefits are other long-term employee benefits. Obligations ensuing from defined employee benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. The calculation involves actuarial assumptions wh ich are further discussed below. The liability recognised under a defined benefit plan represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the f air value of the plan assets available for the direct settlement of obliga tions. The resulting de fined benefit liability is reported on t he balance sheet under the line item ‘Provisions’. At Erste Group, the plan assets consist of qual ifying insurance policies purchased to b ack severance and jubilee benefit provisions. Plan assets for pensio n provision are held by a long-term employee benefit fund. Remeasurements consist of actuarial gains and losses on the define d benefit obligations and the return on plan assets. Remeasur e- ments of pension and severance defined benefit plans are recognised as accumulated OCI in equity specifically under ‘Remeasure-ment of defined benefit plans’ in the statement of changes in equity. The change for the period is reported as OCI in the state ment of comprehensive income in the line ‘Remeasurement of defined be nefit plans’.

A financial guarantee is a contra ct that requires the guarantor to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs in case a specified debtor fails to make a paymen t when due in accordance with th e original or modified terms of a debt instrument. For financial guarantees provisions are recognised based on the ex pected credit loss impairment model if the amount is higher t han the unamortised balance of the initial premium. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under prespecified terms and conditions. Loan commitments are gener-ally not recognised in the balance sheet before they are drawn. If it is probable that the bank will enter into the loan agreem ent loan commitment fees received are deferred and adjust the effective inte rest rate of the loan when the commitment is drawn. Loan com - mitments result in recognition of provisions base d on the expected credit loss impairment model. Expenses or income related to provisions for loan commitments an d financial guarantees are reported in the statement of income under the line item ‘Impairment re sult from financial instruments’. For information about development of credit loss allowances for provision for financial guarantees and loan commitments refer t o Note 39 Development of credit loss allowances, part ‘Loan commi tments and financial guarantees’: table ‘Movement in credit loss allowances – loan commitments and financial guarantees’. PROVISIONS RECOGNISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IAS 37 Expenses or income related to provisions which are in scope of IAS 37 are reported in the statement of income under the line it em ‘Other operating result’."

In 2024, an allocat ion of provisions for risks related to Romanian Co nsumer Protection Claims Act was recognised in the income statement in the amount of EUR 1 million (2023: EUR 8 million). The to tal amount of the provision as of 31 December 2024 was EUR 66 million (2023: EUR 65 million). With respect to the busine ss activities of the Romanian building society subs idiary BCR Banca pentru Locuinte SA (BPL) the reco g- nition of a penalty (in relation to whethe r state subsidies had been disbursed to buil ding society’s clients in accordance with the applicable legal provisions) amounting in total to EUR 78 million (2023: EUR 79 million ) remains and is recognized as liability . In Croatia, the Supreme Court, in a proceeding initiated by a lo cal consumer protection association against several credit inst itutions (‘Collective Case’), among them Erste Bank Croatia (‘EBC’), declar ed in 2015 that Swiss Franc (CHF) clauses in loan agreements with consumers are valid, but contractual provis ions permitting unilateral change of the variable interest rates in CHF denominated con- sumer loans, used by the majority of cred it institutions until 2008, are null and void .

A certain number of CHF denominated loans concluded betwee n 2004 and 2008 are subject of individual cour t proceedings initiate d by clients argui ng to be entitled to restitution on the acco unt of partial nullity of their initial loan agreement although th e conversion was con ducted. A final legal standing on the issue of resti tution claims for converted loans is curr ently under consideration on the level of the Su- preme Court. Due to the uncertainty on the final legal standing and the continuous non-uniform judicial practice of courts in C roatia in regards to converted loans, respective provisio ns for individual cases we re adjusted accordingly. In July 2024, the Federal Fiscal Court rais ed the question whether Art 6 sec 1 subsec 28 (2nd sentence) Austrian VAT Act consti tutes state aid pursuant to Article 107 (1) of th e Treaty on the Functioning of the Europe an Union (TFEU) to the ECJ in proceedings brought by an Austrian bank. A decision can be expected in around one to two years. From today's perspective, we believe there is a high probability that the ECJ will affirm th e existence of state aid in its decision. The calculation of the provision is based on a best estimate. The resulting provis ion amounts to EUR 102 million. 54. Contingent liabilities To meet the financial needs of customers, the bank enters into various irrevocable commitments and contingent liabilities. Even though these obligations may not be recognis ed on the balance sheet, they do involve credit risk and are therefore part of the overall risk of the Bank (see Note 35 Credit risk exposure and 39 Development of Credit loss allowances)."

    "text": "367Legal proceedings Erste Group Bank AG and some of its subsid iaries are involved in legal disputes, most of which have arisen in the course of ord inary banking business. These proceedings are not ex pected to have a significant negative impa ct on the financial position or profita bility of Erste Group or Erste Group Bank AG. Erste Group is also subject to the following on going proceedings, some of which, if adve rsely adjudicated, may have a significant impact on the financial posi tion or profitability of Erste Group or Erste Group Bank AG. An y possible financial impacts of these proceedin gs are not disclosed, as neither the dura tion nor the outcome can be reliably esti mated and to avoid influencing the outcome of the various proceedings. CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS Several subsidiaries of Erste Group have been named in their resp ective jurisdictions as defendan ts in a number of lawsuits and in regulatory proceedings, filed by individual customers, regulatory authorities or consum er protection agencies and associations. Some of the lawsuits are class actions. The proc eedings mainly relate to a llegations that certain contractual provisions, particular ly in re- spect of consumer loans, violate mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations and principles of general civil law and tha t certain fees or parts of interest payments charged to customers in the past must be re paid. The allegations relate to the enfor ceability of certain fees as well as to contractual provisions for the ad justment of interest rates and cu rrencies. In some jurisdictions , the legal risks in connection with loans granted in the past are also incr eased by the enactment of politically-motivated laws impacting existing lending relationships, which may result in repayment obliga tions towards customers. The followi ng consumer protection issues ar e deemed noteworthy. In Romania, BCR is - aside from being a defendant in a number of individual lawsuits initiated by consumers regarding alleged violations of applicable consumer protection laws - among seve ral local credit institutions purs ued by the consumer protection au- thority for allegedly abusive clauses pertai ning to pre-2010 lending practices. In conn ection therewith, BC R is currently a def endant in an individual litigation claim filed by the local consumer pr otection authority on behalf of or several borrowers. The court pro- ceeding is still pending. A potential adverse judgment on the validity of certain contractual clauses may have an impact of inv alidating such clauses also in other si milar agreements concluded by BCR with other consumers. CSAS MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS CLAIMS Following the completion of a sq ueeze-out procedure in CSAS resulting in Erste Group Bank AG becoming the sole shareholder of CSAS, some former minority shareholders of CSAS filed legal actions with the courts in Prague against Erste Group Bank AG.

In case th e courts find there should be an increase, this would affect all minority shareholders squeezed-o ut. In the squeeze-out performed in 2018 Erste Group Bank AG acquired a total of 1.03% of minority shares for a consider ation of approx. EUR 80 million. Erste Grou p Bank AG views that the purchase price, esta blished by a valuation done by professional external experts and in the course of th e ongoing proceeding supported by another ex ternal expert valuation appointed by Erste Group Bank AG, was correct and fair. The competent first instance court in Prague conf irmed the view of Erste Grou p Bank AG of having paid a fair and correct share pric e to the former minority shareholders and ruled against the plaintiffs in its first instance judgement, rejecting their claims for a n increase of the share price being paid out. The judgement was appealed by several plaintiffs. The appellate proceeding is still pending."

These comprise a total of 50 entities , which are members of the Haftungsverbund (cross-guarantee system) of the Austrian savings bank sector. Al ongside Erste Group Bank AG, loca l savings banks, Bausparkasse der österreichischen Sparkassen Aktien gesellschaft, Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG and Zweite Wiener Vereins-Spar- casse are members of the Haftungsverbund (c ross-guarantee system). The scope of consol idation also includes ‘ex-ante fund’ IPS GesbR which can be used solely for the pu rpose to cover loss events of members of th e cross-guarantee syste m. It was establishe d in 2014 and the members are required to pay into the fund until 31 December 2031. Additions and disposals 2024. On 11 September 2024 Erste Asset Management Gm bH (EAM) has signed a purchase agreement to acquire 100% of Impact Asset Management GmbH (IAM), which was previously majority-owned by Cubic (London) Ltd. IAM is an Investment Management company focused on ESG- and Impact Investi ng. This acquisition enables EA M to strengthen its existing market position as leading provider of ES G- and sustainable investments and expand the presence on the German market. The trans - action was effectuated as of 3 December 2024 with the approval of the financial mark et authority and the responsible competitio n authorities. For the assessment of the purchase price allo cation, an external expert opinion has b een commissioned. The expert opinion provi des a goodwill of EUR 64 million and a customer relationship of EUR 30 million. The goodwill was calculated as the difference betwe en the adjusted net asset and the purchase pric e allocation and is not tax-deductible. No other significant assets and liabilities were identified during the purchase price allocation. Assets and liabilities recognized in first consolidation are as follows: in EUR million Carrying Amount Cash and cash balances at central banks 3 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 5 Property and equipment 0 Intangible assets – Goodwill 64 Intangible assets – Customer relationships 30 Trade and other receivables 1 Tax assets 0 Other assets 1 Total Assets 104 Other financial liabilities 1 Tax liabilities 7 Other liabilities 2 Total Liabilities 9 Capital 95 Total Equity 95 Total Liabilities and Equity 104 The fair value of the total consideration amounts to EUR 95 million .

All entities directly or indire ctly controlled by Erste Group Bank AG a re con- solidated in the Group financial statements on the basis of their annual accounts as of 31 December 2024, and for the year then ended. Non-controlling interests represent those portions of total comp rehensive income and net assets that are neither directly nor i ndi- rectly attributable to the owners of Erste Group Bank AG. Non- controlling interests are presente d separately in the consolidate d statement of income, in the consolidated sta tement of comprehensive inco me and within equity on th e consolidated balance sheet. CONTROL Assessing the existence of contro l may require considerable accounting judgemen ts, assumptions and esti mates, notably in non- standard situations such as: — power stemming both from voting rights and from contractual arrangements (or mostly from the latter); — exposure to variable returns fr om the involvement with the in vestee stemming from on-balance investments and from off-balance commitments or guarantees (or mostly from the latter); or from re adily identifiable income stream s (e.g. dividends, interest, f ees) and from cost savings, economies of scale and/or operational synergies (or mostly from the latter). In the case of Erste Group, such accounti ng judgements, assumptions and estimates ha ve been primarily relevant for the assessme nt of the following cases: i. The savings bank members of the Austrian cross-guarantee system (Haftungsverbund) Erste Group Bank AG is a member of the Ha ftungsverbund (cross-guarantee system) of th e Austrian savings bank sector. As of the balance sheet date, all of Austria’s savings banks, in addition to Erste Group Bank AG, Erste Bank der oe sterreichischen Sparka ssen AG and Bausparkasse der österreichischen Sp arkassen Aktiengesellschaft, fo rmed part of this cross-gu arantee system. The provisi ons of the agreement governing the Haftungsverbund are implemente d by the steering company Haftungsverbund GmbH. Erste Group Bank AG always holds directly and indirectly at least 51% of the voting rights of the steering company. The indirect voting rig hts are held through Erste Bank der oesterreichisch en Sparkassen AG and through other savings banks in which companies of Erste Group hold the majority of voting rights. For all savings banks in which Erste Group ho lds less than 50% of the voting rights, an assessment of whether control is achiev ed through the provisions of the Haftungs verbund agreement has been performed. Based on the contractual agreement, Haftun gsverbund GmbH as the steering company is vested with the followi ng substantive right s related to the savings banks: — participation in the appointment of board members; — approval of budgets incl uding capital decisions; — provision of binding guidelines in the areas of risk and liquidity management as we ll as internal audit; and — determination of thresholds fo r capital requirement includin g the payment of dividends.

Furthermore, taking into account the magnitude of Erste Group’ s involvement with the member banks – whether in the form of synergies, investments, commitments, guaran tees, or access to common resources – the Gro up has significant exposure to each of the member banks’ variable returns. As Haft ungsverbund GmbH is able to affect the v ariable returns through its power, it has be en assessed that Haftungsverbund GmbH ha s control over the savings banks. As Erste Group Bank AG controls the steering company, it exer cises control over the members of the cross-guarantee system. ii. Investment funds under own management The Group has assessed whether the investmen t funds it manages through its asset ma nagement subsidiaries are controlled and hence shall be consolidated. This assessment has been made on the basis that power ov er such investment funds is generally con- ferred based on the contractual arrangements appointing an Erste Group subsidiary as fund manager without any substantive re- moval rights by fund’s investors. Furthermore, Erste Group made the conclu sive judgement that its expo sure to such own-managed funds’ variable returns is basically considered as significant if, additionally to the exposure through management fees, Erste Group is also exposed in the form of at least 20% investment in the fu nd. Furthermore, in its capacity as fund manager, Erste Group i s also able to affect the returns of the funds through its power. Follo wing this assessment, investmen t funds under own management in which Erste Group – directly or through its subsidiaries – has significant unit holdin gs (i.e. holds at least 20% of the units issued by the fund) are deemed to be controlled and included in the scope of consolidation."

Pension funds under own management The Group has assessed whether the contractua l arrangements appointing an Erste Group su bsidiary as pension fund manager (with no substantive removal rights by the fund’s participants) are generally expected to confer power over such funds, followed by a n assessment of the Group’s exposure /rights to the pension fund’s v ariable returns.

Direct investments in investment funds. Erste Group is invested in several mutual funds as well as in private investment funds which are registered in Austria, Central- an d Eastern Europe or other countries. The ma jority of those funds is managed by subs idi- aries of Erste Group, the smaller part of the funds being managed by independent thir d parties. The investments in funds held b y Erste Group do not constitute material inve stments (basically below 20%) and mostly take the form of redeemable fund unit inves t- ments. They are measured at fair value on the Group’s balance sh eet and are disclosed as debt securities either under line item ‘Non- trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ or ‘Financial assets held for trading’. Management fees. Moreover, Erste Group earns management fees for providing investment management services as fund manager (by subsidiaries of Erste Group); meaning for making the investment decision for the funds under management of the relevant in- vestment fund. Beside the management fees for the services as fund manager Er ste Group also receives distribut ions for their investments in fu nd units. On the other side stand expenses for the administration of investment funds an d fees for the business activity of invest ment funds, especially custodian fees and fees for securities trading transactions. In the normal course of business activity Erste Group enters into derivative transactions with own-managed unconsol idated investment funds. Moreover, own-managed unconsolidated investment funds are also invested - over di fferent time periods - in debt securities issued by or deposits of Erste Group. In restricted cases Erste Group offers capital guarantees fo r own-managed unconsolidated investment funds.

    "text": "381Deferred share-based remuneration. 30% of the bonus is converted into performanc e share units (PSUs) on the day of the super- visory board resolution using the average share price of the la st 30 trading days. A PSU represents an unsecured, conditional r ight to receive shares of Erste Group Bank AG in the future. In the following five years, the initial number of PSUs is adjusted in a r ange from 120% to 0% to the group’s performance based on performanc e criteria, which the supervisory board reviews on a yearly basis and adjusts in exceptional cases. The final nu mber of PSUs corresponds to the number of shares, which is transferred to the par tici- pant’s securities deposit after a retention period of another year. The awarded shares and PSUs are equity-settl ed share-based payments that vest by the end of the performance year. The determina - tion of the grant date requires an assessm ent of all the circumstances. As the supe rvisory board has significant discretionary powers in connection with the assessment of the perf ormance in the performance year, the grant is made with the resolution of the supe rvi- sory board on the bonus awarded for the past performance year. For the performance year 2024, it is expected that 20,630 shares and 30,944 PSUs (2023: 29,571 sh ares and 44,356 PSUs) will be granted to participants. The fair value of PSUs on the measurem ent date is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation model considering the achievement level of Erste Group performance over the next five years and the shar e price of Erste Group Bank A G. The estimated fair value on the balance sheet date is EUR 3 million (2023: EUR 2 million ). In 2024 in total personnel expenses of EUR 4 million (2023: EUR 3 million) and a correspond ing retained earnings reserve were recognised. PHANTOM SHARES PROGRAM Erste Group grants selected employees every year a bonus for servic es rendered in the past year (v esting period). If the indivi dual bonus exceeds a certain limit, th e final payout amount of at least 25% depends on the development of the average, volume-weight ed, daily price of Erste Group shares in subsequent years (phantom share program). The program applie s to Erste Group entities in different countries, with differe nt amounts and share equivalents. The share equi valents (phantom shares ) are divided into seve ral tranches, which differ in the duration of the observation period for the develo pment of the Erste Group share price. The phantom share program meets the criteria for cash-set tled share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2. The estimated fair value of variable compensation for share equi valents is recognised in profit or loss.

Fair value changes and chan ges of the final allocation in subsequent years are recognised in profit or loss. To determine the fair value, the number of share equivalents not yet paid out as at the balance sheet da te is multiplied by the estimated average price of Erste Group shares for the respec tive payout year. The fair values of the share equivalents for the respective payout year are determined using an option pricing mod el (Black-Scholes model). The main parameters are the share price of the Erste Group share on the balance sheet date and the divid end payments expected until payment. For 2024, it is expected that 233,980 (2023: 280,079) share equi valents with a fair value of EU R 13 million (2023: EUR 10 milli on) will be granted to eligible employees. The total expense recognised in the reporting period for the phantom share program amounts to EUR 26 million (2023: EUR 13 million ), the carrying amount of the liability as at the balance sheet date is EUR 56 million (202 3: EUR 40 million).

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial stateme nts comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2024, and of its financial pe rformance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the IFRS Accounting St andards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and th e additional requirements under Section 59a Austrian Banking Act (BWG) in conjunction with Section 64 BWG and Section 245a Austrian Company Code (UGB). BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 (hereinafter ‘EU Regulation’) and Austrian generally accepted auditing standards. Thos e standards require the application of the Intern ational Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our res pon- sibilities under those provisions and standar ds are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the C onsoli- dated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with Austrian Ge nerally Accepted Accounting Principles, the provisions of the Austrian Banking Act and professional requir ements and we have fulfilled our other ethi cal responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor’ s report is sufficient and app ropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most si gnificance in our audit of the consolida ted financial statements of the fiscal year. Thes e matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial state- ments as a whole, and in forming our op inion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have structured key audit matters as follows: — Description — Audit approach — Reference to related disclosures Impairments of Loans and Advances to Customers (expected credit losses) DESCRIPTION Impairments of Loans and Advances represen t management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected with respect to the loan portfolio at balance sheet date. For loans and advances to customers in th e amount of EUR 209.0 billion, measured at amortized cost, Erste Group Bank AG has recognized credit loss allowances in the amount of EUR 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2024.

    "text": "405The models used for determining loss allowances are specific to the types of loan portfolios. There are country-specific and fo rward- looking features both with regard to products and economic environment that are re levant to the respective loss estimate result ing in heightened complexity of models and input factors. The uncertainty inherent in the estimation of impairments of loans and advances , in particular the consideration of future econ omic conditions, are in 2024 significant due to th e geopolitical and ec onomic developments. Erste Group Bank AG has taken this into account by collective staging and in-model adjustments (overlays). Details on the methodology ar e presented in Note 40. Due to — the volume of risk provisions — the complexity of models and interdependent assu mptions and the resu lting audit effort — a high degree of uncertainty of future economic developments, which led to a high degree of auditor judgement and — the substantial judgement to be applied by the management in designing overlays, incl . determination and de finition of weights for future macroeconomic scenarios we identified this area to be a key audit matter. AUDIT APPROACH To assess the appropriateness of impairmen ts of loans and advances to customers, we: — updated our understanding of the Expected Credit Loss calculation methodology applie d by Erste Group Bank AG based on pol- icies, documentation and interviews and assessed its compliance with the requirements of IFRS 9. We focused specifically on adjustments to methods and processe s made in order to capture the increased uncertainties of the present and future environment in expected credit losses. — evaluated the control activities in credit risk management and lending business processes and te sted key controls, in particula r with respect to the approv al of loans, ongoing monitoring and the early warn ing system as well as the processes arou nd the earl y identification of default, as well as understood and ev aluated the UTP assessment (unlikeness to pay assessment). — evaluated control activities and tested key controls in the area of rating models and collateral valuation and critically asses sed the valuation of collaterals base d on risk adjusted sampling. — assessed model governance and validation processes and critically reviewed the information brought to the attention of the man- agement. We evaluated, with the support fr om our internal credit risk modelling expe rts, the results of back-testing and model validations. — examined and critically assessed the approp riateness of credit risk parameters and models, taking into account possible structu ral breaks in the observable data, and assessed the plausibility of expectations and estima tes made on the basis of such biases, to identify significant increa ses in the credit risk of individual customers or groups of customers. — assessed the correctness of the stage allocation for se lected portfolios based on applicable policies. — analyzed sensitivities and impacts of IFRS 9 specific model aspects. — evaluated whether key components of the calculation of expected cr edit"

In particular, we have co m- pared the underlying macro-economic forecasts with external sources of information and critically assessed the individual weights attributed to scenarios. — tested, on a sample basis, whether default events have been identified in accordance with applicable policies, and evaluated whether events occurred that significantly affect the borrower’s ability to repay loans and advances. Furthermore, we tested, o n a sample basis, the adequacy of individual loan loss allowances assessing the scenarios adopted and the estimation of expected ca sh flows made.

LIMITED ASSURANCE CONCLUSION Based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated sustainabilit y reporting included in the section ‘Susta inability Statement’ of the Management rep ort is not prepared, in all material re spects, in accordance with the requirements of Art. 29a (1) to (5), of the Directive 2013/34/EU , includ- ing — compliance with the Euro pean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), — the process carried out to determine the information to be reported pursuant to ESRS (hereinafter the ‘materiality assessment process’) and its description set out in chapter ‘IRO-1 - Description of the processes for de termining and eval uating material climate-related impacts, ri sks and opportunities’, and — compliance with the reporting re quirements pursuant to Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (hereinafter ‘EU Tax- onomy Regulation’). BASIS FOR CONCLUSION We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the legal requirements and prof essional standards and comple- mentary guidance applicable in Austria with regard to other as surance engagements. In a limited assurance engagement, the assur - ance procedures performed are le ss in extent than for a reasonable assurance en gagement, and, consequently, the level of assura nce obtained is lower than in a re asonable assurance engagement. Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are fu rther described in the ‘Practit ioners’ responsibilities for th e limited assurance engagement of the ‘consolidated susta inability reporting’ section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordan ce with Austrian professional regulations and Art. 22ff AP-RL, to the extent applica ble, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibi lities in accordance wi th these requirements. Our audit firms are subject to the requirem ents of KSW-PRL 2022, which essentially corr esponds to the requirements of ISQM 1, applying a comprehensive quality management system, including docu mented guidelines and procedures to adhere to ethical re- quirements, professional standards as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained as of the date of this assurance report is suffic ient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion as at that date. COMPARATIVE INFORMATION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2023 Comparative information was not subject to a comparable assurance engagement. Other information Management is responsible for other informat ion. Other information comprises any inform ation included in th e group consolidated financial statements, the Management report for the Group, the annual report, except the Sustainability Statement and our assur ance report.

Our purpose is to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together and positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people. We are delivering against our purpose through our R&D based on science of the immune system and new technologies and leveraging our leadership in developing new vaccines and specialty medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory/immunology and oncology. We understand that being a responsible business means getting ahead of disease together in the right way. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts are embedded in our strategy to support our long-term growth, build trust with our stakeholders, reduce risk and deliver positive social impact. Our approach is centred around six core areas: Access to healthcare; global health and health security; environment; diversity, equity and inclusion; ethical standards; and product governance. This report sets out the progress we are making in each area and supplements our Annual Report and the disclosures we publish on our website. We measure our ESG progress through our ESG Performance Rating, introduced in 2022 as one of our corporate key performance indictors to drive performance and provide greater transparency in our ESG reporting. The executive leadership team and the Board, via the Corporate Responsibility Committee, review the metrics that make up this Rating each year to ensure they are sufficiently challenging and ambitious. I am proud of the continued progress we have made this year, leveraging science, technology and talent to deliver a positive impact on some of society’s most urgent challenges. Our 2023 ESG Performance Rating was ‘on track’ for the second consecutive year. More details can be found on pages 5-8. The performance against the metrics that contribute to this rating and the overall ESG Performance Rating score have been independently assured for 2023, along with other priority ESG data in this report. Our 2023 performance included: –Reaching 89 million people in lower income countries through access partnerships –Gavi confirming the rollout of our malaria vaccine, Mosquirix , in up to 12 countries in Africa – Progressed 11 global health pipeline assets for priority WHO diseases and worked with partners to get ready to start phase III trial for our promising candidate vaccine, M72/AS01E, against tuberculosis –Significant commitment to strengthening health security with 12 R&D projects targeting pathogens deemed ‘critical’ or ‘urgent’ by the WHO and the US CDC –Ready for phase III trials of a low-carbon version of our rescue metered dose inhaler (MDI) medication, Ventolin , to begin in 2024 with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of this inhaler by 90% – important as our Scope 3 emissions increased in 2023 due to increased sales of this product –Decreased overall water use by 24% and by 11% for sites in high water-stress regions, against our 2020 baseline –At the end of the year, women held 45% of VP-and-above roles globally, and we had"

This includes the rapidly changing ESG regulatory landscape and expectations of companies’ ESG disclosures. In 2023, we began necessary preparations for new sustainability reporting requirements, including the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and committed to adopt TNFD-aligned disclosures based on 2025 data. We look forward to delivering further strong ESG performance alongside our improving outlook for sustained growth through the decade.

To deliver on our purpose, we need to consider ESG impacts across everything we do, from the lab to the patient. That’s why ESG is embedded in our strategy and supports our sustainable performance and long-term growth. It helps us to build trust with and generate value for our stakeholders, reduce risk to our operations and create positive social impact. We have identified six ESG focus areas that address what is most material to our business and the issues that matter the most to our stakeholders. These focus areas are core to our strategy and are where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of society’s most urgent challenges, including those set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). They are: –Access to healthcare –Global health and health security –Environment –Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) –Ethical standards –Product governance These focus areas were informed by our most recent materiality assessment in 2022, which reaffirmed that the most material issues for our business were well aligned with our six ESG focus areas. We recognise that being a responsible business is not a static requirement. We began work on our double materiality assessment, which will be completed in 2024. This means that we will continue to evolve our approach in response to the rapidly changing operating environment and strive for continuous improvement to ensure we maintain strong ESG performance. gsk.com: Our materiality assessment Our contribution to the UN SDGs The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out a vision for ending poverty, hunger and inequality, and protecting the planet’s natural resources, by 2030. The six ESG areas that we have identified, and which are core to our strategy, are where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of society’s most urgent challenges, including those set out in the SDGs. As a global biopharma company, we can make the most significant contribution to SDG3: Good Health and Wellbeing. We publish our contribution to the SDGs on our website. gsk.com: Our contribution to the SDGsStakeholder engagement Our approach to ESG is guided by continuous engagement with our stakeholders. Our key stakeholders include our patients, shareholders, customers and employees. We undertake formal materiality assessments every two-to-three years and engage with our stakeholders to ensure that our ESG focus areas continue to address the most material issues for our business. How we engage with our stakeholders is covered throughout this report. This includes engagement with our people (see page 8), our partnerships with NGOs and our membership of cross- industry collaborations. We also discuss our engagement with stakeholders in our Annual Report, which includes how our Board considers stakeholders in decision-making. (See our section 172 statement on page 123).

For more information on our approach to stakeholder engagement, see our policies and publications on gsk.com. gsk.com: Materiality • Engaging with patient organisations • Engaging with healthcare professionals • Investors hub – ESG ESG governance Our ESG performance is monitored regularly by both our Board- level Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and the GSK Leadership Team (GLT). The CRC oversees our progress against our commitments, including performance and how we are meeting the expectations of our stakeholders. It collaborates with other Board committees, such as the Remuneration Committee and the Audit & Risk Committee, to ensure that ESG performance is integrated across the business. The GLT and senior management are responsible for delivery against our six focus areas, and report regularly to the CRC on progress (see pages pages 128-129 of our Annual Report). ESG-aligned remuneration In 2022, the Remuneration Committee, with the support of the CRC, introduced ESG performance measures into both our short- and long-term incentive plans, to reward delivery of key ESG measures. The ESG element consists of: human capital management in the form of diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, which forms 10% of the annual bonus opportunity for the GLT; and our climate and nature ambitions, which form 10% of our long-term incentive plan opportunity for senior leaders. These metrics align to our ESG Performance Rating. See page 139 of our Annual Report for further information.Our approach Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is embedded in our strategy. It helps us deliver our purpose and supports our sustainable performance and long-term growth."

    "text": "5 GSK ESG Performance Report 2023 March 2024Our ESG Performance Rating Our ESG Performance Rating helps us integrate ESG into the delivery of our strategy and allows us to measure and verify the progress we are making. The rating is one of our corporate KPIs and measures progress against key metrics aligned to each of our six focus areas. In 2023, this included 22 metrics, which are summarised on pages 6-8. We continue to evolve our ESG Performance Rating to ensure it meets the expectations of our stakeholders. The executive leadership team and the Board, via the Corporate Responsibility Committee, review the metrics that make up this Rating each year to ensure they are sufficiently challenging and ambitious. This year, we have removed two metrics, relating to Access and Ethical standards, and added one relating to antimicrobial (AMR) resistance. We met one of our 2022 metrics relating to Access by developing and publishing pricing and access principles so it is no longer required. We have also removed one of our Ethical standards metrics that tracks the number of employees leaving GSK for misconduct. Increases or decreases in this number could indicate either a higher/lower number of breaches or stronger/ weaker enforcement of our processes, so setting a threshold is not an effective measure for success in upholding our standards. We continue to monitor this data internally and publish it externally (see page 32). We have three additional metrics which provide a strong measure of our commitment to ethical standards. We have added a metric within Global health and health security, focused on AMR. AMR is an urgent public health threat, and we have seen increased stakeholder interest in our approach. We updated our biodiversity target which measured the number of high risk materials implementing sustainable sourcing roadmaps as we achieved it in 2022. Our new target focuses on deforestation free sourcing of paper and palm oil. How we assess performance The GLT is accountable for delivering progress against our ESG metrics and regularly reviews performance along with the Board’s CRC. This helps to ensure that accountability for ESG performance is embedded within the business. Each individual metric is assessed as either: on track (the metric has been met or exceeded); on track with work to do (at least 80% of the metric has been achieved); or off track (metric has been missed by more than 20%). We calculate the overall ESG Performance Rating by aggregating performance across all metrics into a single score to illustrate whether we are on track, on track with work to do, or off track. This rating is defined below: On track: 70% or more of all metrics are on track On track with work to do: more than 50% of all metrics are either on track, or on track with work to do Off track: more than 50% of all metrics are off trackOur approach continuedOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix"

Our culture We are committed to making GSK a place where people can thrive, with a culture where we are all ambitious for patients, accountable for impact, and do the right thing. This means we support our people to do things better and faster, focusing on what matters most. It means setting clear objectives, creating accountability for results and giving everyone the support and space they need to succeed. It means doing everything responsibly with integrity and care, because people and patients around the world count on us. Our culture is embedded in everything we do from our recruitment and onboarding, training and development, to our assessments of performance and promotion. Our Code sets out our culture as well as the commitments GSK and our people make so we can deliver on our ambition in the right way. Our people sign up to The Code annually and personally commit ‘I’m in’. gsk.com: See The Code on gsk.com Helping people thrive Making GSK a place where people thrive is core to our Ahead Together ambition. While thriving is different for each individual, there are common themes that matter to everyone. Firstly, a belief in our purpose and a desire to live our culture and contribute to delivering our ambition. Secondly, feeling included and able to be yourself with opportunities to keep growing, with the support, feedback and space needed to succeed. And finally, feeling good, with positive mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing. This means GSK should be a place where people feel welcome and valued, in an environment (including our policies, workplaces and ways of working) that enables and supports them to deliver at their best. Welcoming and developing outstanding people We are committed to developing outstanding people and giving them opportunities to grow. We expect all our people to have an agreed development plan, regardless of grade or role, based on a conversation to understand what space and support they need to succeed. We continue to invest in learning and development initiatives which everyone can access through our Keep Growing Campus, our training and knowledge sharing platform. Digital and technology remain core to our purpose and delivery of our ambitions. We have built our people's skills in this area with global events such as DataCon, where all employees can experience immersive sessions to see first-hand how to apply digital, data and tech tools including generative AI to become more digitally fluent. This year, more than 7,000 employees took part from every business unit and 28 countries. In our Data Academy, employees can access resources and online training.

By having access to senior global leaders from the beginning of their career with us, we aim to provide a more intimate connection to GSK and the patients we serve, creating emotional connection with our purpose, strategy and culture, to complement ongoing local onboarding activities. Supporting our people managers Our people managers play a crucial role in helping their teams to thrive and connecting the contributions the team makes to the patient and GSK's broader impact. We expect people managers to motivate, focus, care for and develop their teams and we deliver training anchored in these four areas. In 2023 all of our VPs were invited to attend a four day in-person event called Leading Leaders, a programme to help leaders bring out the best in their teams and foster the culture we need to succeed together. We also continue to invest in growing the next generation of senior leaders to support our talent and succession needs through bespoke development interventions, equipping them with leadership skills for the future. Maintaining momentum on diversity, equity and inclusion We are continuing our focus on building a more diverse organisation and an equitable and inclusive culture so that everyone feels welcome, valued and included. By taking steps to ensure equal opportunity and non-discrimination, we are delivering on our ambition to make our leadership and teams more diverse and inclusive. We support development for all with numerous offerings for our employees, including an award- winning leadership development programme, Accelerating Difference. Also, all our people complete a mandatory DEI module as part of our annual training, this year focused on how to create an inclusive workplace so all our people can thrive. For more details on our DEI aspirations, see the Responsible Business section on page Error! Bookmark not defined.. Health, wellbeing and volunteering Our health and wellbeing benefits support people through different life stages and are fair and inclusive. These include: a global minimum standard of 18 weeks’ parental leave for primary and secondary carers for all forms of family, a global minimum standard for care of a family member for end of life or serious health emergencies, insured benefits to include same-sex partners wherever possible, and mental health training – available to everyone. We have also enhanced our financial wellbeing support for employees by introducing the ‘nudge’ financial education platform in over 50 countries, helping people manage their finances and achieve their financial goals. In 2023 we reignited volunteering across the company, focused on our ambition and charitable investment themes (Health for people, Health for the planet, Innovators for the future). All employees can volunteer for one or two days each year by taking part in team-based hands-on ‘Together Days’ or through skills- based volunteering.

Performance with Choice Performance with Choice, our approach to hybrid working for those in office-based roles (about a quarter of our people), allows the right balance of on-site and remote working. We are clear in our expectations that people take accountability to spend enough time together in person, while maintaining flexibility, to help us continue to build our sense of community and connectedness, enable development and achieve our Ahead Together ambitions. Data from our annual employee survey shows broad support for our approach and expectations. Recognising and rewarding our people Sharing our success and recognising and rewarding our people equitably, not just on the progress we have made but how we have made it, continues to be an important part of our culture. In addition to our bonus scheme that rewards performance across the company, each year we award 10% of our people with extra ‘Ahead Together’ awards for delivering exceptional performance in line with being accountable for their impact, ambitious for patients and doing the right thing. And we identify 5% of people as having missed performance for those not delivering on their objectives or living the culture. How our people experience GSK To ensure we continue to listen to our people, we regularly measure their experience of GSK as a place to work. This includes an annual survey for all employees featuring questions on engagement, confidence, inclusivity, our culture focus areas and trust priorities. We are proud that our engagement levels remained high at 81% in 2023. We also continue to see high scores with positive upward trends in confidence in delivery of our strategy and our culture focus areas – ambitious for patients, accountability for impact and doing the right thing – as well as measures of inclusion. In 2023 we expanded analysis of the survey to understand differences in employee experience across diverse characteristics.

To help achieve this, we have a goal to reach 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our medicines and vaccines. We will do this by making our products available at prices that are affordable for patients and sustainable for our business. It takes significant time, risk and investment to successfully discover and develop new medicines and vaccines. That investment then creates products that make a huge difference to patients and society, and generates the financial returns required to fund the next generation of medicines and vaccines. Getting the balance right between responsible pricing and sustainable business is a fundamental part of our commitment to ESG. To help us find that balance, we follow our pricing and access principles, which we first published in 2022 and updated in October 2023. gsk.com: Pricing and access principles Access We aim to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by the end of 2030. We will do this by making our vaccines and medicines available as widely as possible, through responsible pricing, strategic access programmes and partnerships.

We involve the patient in the development of our medicines and vaccines to identify real-world disease challenges. We set responsible prices in line with the benefits we bring to patients and health systems, measured by clinical, economic and social outcomes. We compare our offer to what is already available for patients and we generate evidence from clinical trials to establish the added value provided by our medicines and vaccines. We adjust our pricing in line with the socio-economic status of a country to ensure affordability and availability. This includes using tiered pricing for vaccines that address public health priorities in low and middle income countries based on the World Bank gross national income classification.

ViiV Healthcare provides non-profit pricing for antiretroviral medicines for HIV for use in public health programmes in all low-income, least developed and Sub-Saharan African countries. We work within existing payer systems and recognise the need to balance health budgets for the societies we serve. We recognise health inequities, including in higher income countries, and fund dedicated activities to reach underserved populations. These include disease education and helping uninsured and underinsured patients to navigate health benefits, as well as access programmes to provide financial and disease management support. In the US, for example, we provided prescribed medicines and vaccines to more than 71,000 low- income uninsured, underinsured and Medicare Part D patients in 2023, through GSK and ViiV Healthcare’s Patient Assistance Programs Foundation. We operate under robust pricing approvals, developing access plans informed by payers. We also work to create stability and predictability for payers and our business, engaging proactively on upcoming product launches for budget planning, and adjusting prices to account for inflation. In the US in 2023, our combined average net price (after discounts, rebates or other allowances) for our pharmaceutical and vaccines portfolio increased by 0.4%, while the average list price increased by 3.2%, compared with 5.4% (list) for the industry. Over the past five years, the average net price for our products increased 0.3% annually, while the average list price rose by 3.3%, compared with 4.7% (list) for the industry.

    "text": "11 GSK ESG Performance Report 2023 March 2024Providing access for patients in lower income countries People living in lower income countries continue to be disproportionately affected by infectious diseases. We want to develop access strategies that make a real difference. In 2023, we reached 89 million people with our vaccines and antiretrovirals in lower income countries. We systematically evaluate our pipeline, in consultation with global health partners, to identify which products will benefit low- and lower middle-income countries so we can develop effective and focused access plans. In least-developed countries and low-income countries, we do not file patents for our medicines or enforce historic patents. This lets other companies manufacture and supply generic versions of our medicines in those countries. We also support equitable access to impactful GSK products by implementing responsible pricing strategies based on a country’s ability to pay (measured by Gross National Income). Vaccines We reserve our lowest vaccine prices for Gavi and similar organisations. We have partnered with Gavi since its foundation in 2000 and have supplied more than one billion vaccine doses to date, at our lowest prices to the lowest income countries. In 2023, through our partnership we significantly increased our supply to deliver around 5 million doses of Cervarix , a critical vaccine in lower income countries for addressing cervical cancer. In 2023, we supplied around 41 million doses of our pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix , to seven Gavi-eligible countries at our lowest price. Our vaccine against rotavirus, Rotarix , reaches children across 25 Gavi-eligible countries and four former Gavi countries. We have offered vaccines to civil society organisations serving refugees and working in other emergency situations through the Humanitarian Mechanism since 2017. We are also a long-standing supplier of oral polio vaccines through UNICEF and, in 2023, supplied around 130 million doses to help eradicate polio. Neglected tropical diseases We have been working with our partners since 1999 to tackle neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), including lymphatic filariasis (LF), a debilitating disease caused by a parasite transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, and to reduce morbidity from intestinal worms and echinococcosis. In 2023, we donated 615 million albendazole tablets to help end these NTDs, taking the total we have donated to over 11 billion. So far, LF has been eliminated in 19 countries including Bangladesh and Lao PDR, who announced elimination of the disease in 2023. These are significant milestones in our collaborative effort to get ahead of disease together. The number of tablets we are donating is declining each year, given the gradual eradication of the NTDs that the medicine is targeting. The programme has benefited over 935 million people since it began, according to WHO data. We remain committed to supplying albendazole to endemic countries until LF is eliminated everywhere. HIV We support the development of generic versions of our products through voluntary licences to help improve access by increasing manufacturing capacity and enabling lower prices in eligible countries. In 2023, Aurobindo, Cipla and Viatris, three generic manufacturers, signed sub-licences of ViiV Healthcare’s"

In 2023, Aurobindo, Cipla and Viatris, three generic manufacturers, signed sub-licences of ViiV Healthcare’s licence with the Medicines Patent Pool to develop, manufacture and supply generic versions of cabotegravir long-acting for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (cabotegravir LA for PrEP) in 90 countries, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals. Compared with oral HIV prevention options, cabotegravir LA for PrEP is more complex to manufacture and ViiV is supporting the companies with technical know-how to enable generic development and access as soon as possible. ViiV also works with global health agencies, non-governmental organisations, governments and community partners to plan for and support the introduction of ViiV-manufactured cabotegravir LA for PrEP into national programmes. In late 2023, first orders of cabotegravir LA for PrEP were delivered to a global partner for programmatic use in low- and middle-income countries. ViiV Healthcare also has voluntary licensing agreements with 15 generic manufacturers to produce and sell low-cost single or fixed-dose combination products containing our HIV medicine dolutegravir for adults. These agreements cover 95 low- and middle-income countries, with one direct licence and the others via the Medicines Patent Pool. There are similar agreements with 14 generic manufacturers for children, covering 123 countries, as well as separate agreements to enable greater access to dolutegravir in certain upper middle-income countries. This includes generic dolutegravir dispersible tablet 10mg formulations for children living with HIV, which first received FDA tentative approval under the US PEPFAR scheme three years ago and are now available in more than 90 countries. This access has been facilitated by ViiV’s public-private partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Unitaid and two generic manufacturers with sub-licences from the Medicines Patent Pool. In total, around 24 million people living with HIV across 128 countries had access to a generic product containing dolutegravir by the end of 2023. This is more than 90% of people living with HIV on antiretrovirals in generic-accessible low- and middle- income countries.

Developed by GSK and our partners, Mosquirix is a significant scientific breakthrough – it is the world’s first malaria vaccine and the first vaccine against any human parasite. In July 2023, Gavi announced that up to nine African countries are to be allocated doses of Mosquirix from early 2024. In early 2024, Cameroon and Burkina Faso became the first countries to introduce the vaccine into routine immunisation programmes. We have committed to supply 18 million doses to Gavi-eligible countries between 2023 and 2025, with a plan to produce 15 million doses annually from 2026 to 2028. To significantly increase supply of the vaccine in the medium term, we are transferring technology know-how to Bharat Biotech of India, which will be the sole supplier of the vaccine from 2029. We continue to make good progress on this product transfer. In 2023, results from a landmark study by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine showed that combining Mosquirix with antimalarial drugs in areas of Africa with seasonal malaria reduced malaria cases and deaths in young children over a period of five years. These findings confirm the potential of seasonal vaccination to provide a high level of protection over the first five years of life, when this protection is much needed. Strengthening healthcare systems We collaborate with partners to strengthen healthcare systems, which is key to addressing systemic issues which reduce access to healthcare, vaccines and treatments and which perpetuate health inequalities in lower income countries. We work with people and underserved communities to make sure that they take the lead in the decisions that affect them and their health, and we help support emergency preparedness and response. We work in partnership with organisations that are active within local communities and look to catalyse additional resources to increase impact. In 2023, GSK and ViiV Healthcare joined forces with The Global Fund to pledge $7.5 million over three years to create the Gender Equality Fund, which will support community- based and -led organisations that are working to deliver lasting changes in health policies and programmes, transform gender norms and eliminate discrimination to improve health outcomes, with a focus on TB, HIV and malaria. The Gates Foundation has committed to match this donation, in support of The Global Fund's work. Mobilised and connected community-based organisations are a vital part of health systems, enabling access to and delivery of services, especially for hard-to-reach populations. Positive Action, ViiV Healthcare's community grant-giving programme, works directly with the communities most affected by HIV to further the ViiV Healthcare mission of ensuring no person living with HIV is left behind.

To date, the partnership has provided more than 3.5 million children with essential healthcare, trained and equipped more than 39,000 health workers in the most remote and marginalised communities, and advocated for the incorporation of stronger policies to protect children’s health at country and global level. Building on learnings over the last decade, we are focusing our partnership on reducing the number of ‘zero dose’ children – those who have never received a vaccine – in Ethiopia and Nigeria, which represent more than a third of the zero-dosed children in Africa. Last year, we launched two new programmes as part of our long-standing partnership with Amref Health Africa. One focuses on malaria in Kenya and Zambia, and the second will address anti-microbial resistance (AMR) across the region. It will work with WHO Regional Office for Africa and the African CDC to identify and assess national AMR plans and support their implementation. GSK and ViiV Healthcare are committed to responding to humanitarian crises where possible. To date, GSK has donated more than £6 million to a number of partners, including the Red Cross, Save the Children and The Global Fund, directly responding to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. In 2023, ViiV Healthcare continued to donate antiretroviral medicines to national HIV and AIDS programmes in Poland to support people living with HIV who have been affected by the conflict in Ukraine. To date, the company has donated more than 10,000 packs. Positive Action also launched its Ukraine Emergency Response Fund.

    "text": "16 GSK ESG Performance Report 2023 March 2024Global health and health security continued Breakthroughs in malaria research and treatment The latest data shows that there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and over 600,000 deaths caused by malaria in 2022, according to the WHO, with over 90% of those in Africa. More than three-quarters were of children under five. To date, together with our partners, we’ve brought two products for the prevention and treatment of malaria to market – the world’s first vaccine against malaria (see Access, page 10), and a single-dose, radical cure for P. vivax malaria as reported in 2022. Getting ahead of malaria is particularly challenging due to growing resistance to existing drugs and insecticides and as climate change enables the spread of the disease, so we are investing to develop the next generation of transformative tools. In August 2023, we announced that GSK scientists had discovered a strain of a naturally occurring bacterium that could potentially help eradicate the disease. The Tres Cantos 1 (TC1) strain of the Delftia tsuruhatensis bacterium – named after the GSK R&D facility where it was discovered – significantly reduces the load of P. falciparum malaria parasites in mosquitoes. This could potentially inhibit transmission of the parasite to humans. TC1 was shown to be effective in multiple types of Anopheles mosquito and against multiple types of malaria parasite. The ground- breaking research was conducted in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It also used data from semi-field studies conducted with the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé (IRSS) in a contained ‘MosquitoSphere’ facility in Burkina Faso. This suggests that the laboratory findings could be successfully translated to the field for malaria control. We continue to pursue this ground- breaking research while engaging with global health institutions and partners to identify the most effective and sustainable approach for development and mobilisation if successful. Supporting innovation through capacity and capability building Through our Africa Open Lab initiative, launched in 2014, we support early-career scientists based in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on infectious diseases that disproportionately affect sub-Saharan populations, such as malaria, TB and AMR. In 2023, we agreed grants to ten researchers in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa and we announced a further call for proposals in November. We are also working with African academic institutions to provide grantees with supplemental training in areas including epidemiology, statistics and clinical research. Strengthening health security There are many factors that can jeopardise our health security – from new and emerging infectious diseases to the rise of AMR. Climate change and nature loss also can change disease patterns. We are using our scientific know-how and collaborating with others to help the world better prepare for future health challenges.

Getting ahead of AMR through innovation and appropriate use Founded on GSK’s science and technology, our primary contribution to strengthening health security is through our innovation to prevent and mitigate infectious disease. This includes investing in innovation to get ahead of infections where new antimicrobials and vaccines are urgently needed. We have more than 30 R&D projects across medicines and vaccines that are relevant to AMR, ranging from early- to late-stage development, with 12 R&D projects targeting pathogens deemed ‘critical’ or ‘urgent’ by the WHO and the US CDC. These include gepotidacin, which could be the first novel oral antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) in over 20 years. Positive phase III data from the EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 phase III trials were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Copenhagen in April 2023. Through our partnership with Spero Therapeutics, Inc., we have an exclusive licence agreement for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage oral carbapenem antibiotic with the potential to treat complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). In December 2023, the first patient was dosed in PIVOT-PO, our pivotal phase III trial for tebipenem. If approved, tebipenem HBr will address an unmet medical need for a novel oral antibiotic as an alternative to intravenous hospital therapy for drug-resistant cUTIs. In March 2023, we announced an exclusive licence agreement with Scynexis for Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp tablets), a first-in-class antifungal for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Vaccines remain an important pathway to getting ahead of resistant infections. During the year, the US FDA granted a Fast Track designation for our investigational vaccine against gonorrhoea – which is the second most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with an estimated 82 million new cases globally each year. It is recognised as an urgent unmet medical need due to its growing global incidence and reduced efficacy of available treatments as drug-resistant strains are increasing.

We continue to progress candidate vaccines against several enteric diseases which contribute to the burden of AMR, including invasive non-typhoidal salmonella, klebsiella, shigella, typhoid and paratyphoid fever. In 2023, it was announced that we are partnering with LimmaTech Biologics for the further development of one candidate vaccine against shigellosis, while we continue to develop another candidate vaccine against the disease which uses our vaccine platform technology, GMMA. Currently, there are no vaccines to help prevent shigellosis, a disease which causes 600,000 deaths each year. Ensuring appropriate use of antibiotics Ensuring appropriate access to infectious disease interventions is key to getting ahead of health security threats. We continue to maintain a strong focus on the appropriate use of antibiotics and enabling access to them. We are committed to exploring lower income focused indications of our antimicrobials and vaccines in development, to help maximise their health impact. We continue to train healthcare professionals around the world on using and prescribing antibiotics appropriately, and the importance of surveillance studies. As well as maintaining our long-running multinational Survey of Antibiotic Resistance programme, we are developing new resistance surveillance programmes to support antimicrobial assets in late-stage development. In January 2023, the Infection Index launched in India. This has been designed to provide convenient access to information and data to support physicians with appropriate antibiotic decision-making. To support the responsible manufacturing of antibiotics, we work with the AMR Industry Alliance to set global limits for wastewater antibiotic discharges from factories (see Environment, page 18). Our work to strengthen responsible manufacturing of antibiotics was highlighted as an example of good practice in a 2023 report on the issue from the Access to Medicine Foundation’s AMR Benchmark.

This puts increasing pressure on healthcare systems, which already account for nearly 5% of global emissions. That’s why we have set ambitious environmental goals for 2030 and 2045. These aim to address our impacts across our entire value chain, from drug discovery to disposal of our products. They will help make GSK more resilient, protect our supply chains, help us adapt ahead of anticipated regulation change and provide potential growth opportunities as demand increases for medicines and vaccines with a lower environmental impact.We are also working to address the impacts of climate change on health. We’re investing in R&D for medicines and vaccines for climate aggravated, infectious diseases which disproportionately impact the most vulnerable communities and working with our partners to increase the resilience of healthcare systems to climate change.

This was primarily due to energy efficiency measures and increasing the amount of renewable electricity we use. For example, our Nashik site in India has reduced its emissions by 93% since 2020, by moving to renewable biomass for heat and to renewable electricity. As a member of the RE100 initiative, we have committed to reach 100% of our imported electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and 100% of all electricity we generate and import from renewable sources by 2030. In 2023, we reached 83% imported renewable electricity, an increase of 10% from 2022. We signed a power purchase agreement to source renewable electricity to cover 50% of our electricity demand for our sites in Europe from mid-2026. Two additional wind turbines and the new solar farm at our manufacturing facility in Irvine, Scotland began generating renewable energy. We seek to follow leading practice in laboratory sustainability. In 2023, seven of our laboratories in the United States, Canada and the UK achieved My Green Lab Certification, which is considered the gold standard for laboratory sustainability best practices around the world, covering community engagement, energy, water, waste and resource management. Three of these received the highest level of certification. We now have ten laboratories certified across our network with a further ten in the assessment process. We are a member of EV100 and are committed to transition 100% of our fleet to electric or hybrid vehicles and to install chargers at 100 of our sites by 2030. Plug-in-hybrid or fully electric vehicles made up 6% of our sales fleet and 16% of our total fleet in 2023. We have chargers at 30 major sites and have increased the number of charging points to nearly 500. Addressing our Scope 3 emissions Our overall Scope 3 emissions are 10% lower than our baseline year of 2020, although there was a 4% increase in 2022 (our latest available data) compared with 2021. This was primarily driven by higher sales of metered dose inhaler products. We set out below the steps we are taking to reduce the emissions associated with metered dose inhalers. Although overall Scope 3 emissions increased from 2021 to 2022, in the same period, we reduced upstream Scope 3 emissions from our suppliers, see more below. Supply chain emissions The goods and services we buy to make our medicines and vaccines, and additional upstream emissions, account for approximately 31% of our total carbon emissions footprint.

At the same time, we actively support our suppliers to adopt new environmental sustainability measures, with a particular focus on the top 30 suppliers by climate and nature impact. We have started to include contract clauses on carbon reductions for these priority suppliers. In 2023, 23% of our top 30 suppliers by carbon emissions have submitted science based targets for validation, and eight of those have had the targets approved. In 2023, we completed deep-dives for two of our key suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce energy and water usage and switch to renewable energy sources. We are also engaging more broadly across our supply chain. In May 2023, as part of our Supplier Forum, attended by 56 suppliers, we held three sustainability roundtables focused on addressing common challenges and potential solutions. We launched the Sustainability Foundations programme in January 2023 with over 50 GSK procurement employees attending three hours of training, focused on climate and nature. Participants reported a 60% increase in confidence and competence in explaining our ambition to suppliers and ensuring our environmental goals are aligned. Supply chain emissions are a shared challenge for our sector, so we are working in collaboration across our industry through programmes like Activate, Energize and the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) Health Systems Task Force, to find solutions.

GSK’s rescue metered dose inhaler (MDI) medication, Ventolin (salbutamol) is an essential medicine prescribed to approximately 35 million people with respiratory conditions worldwide. Patient use of this inhaler, due to the current propellant, accounts for just under half (48%) of our carbon footprint. We are investing in a low-carbon programme with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the inhaler by 90% by transitioning to a next generation, lower-carbon propellant. Phase III trials will begin in 2024 and, if successful, regulatory submissions will start in 2025. This is to supplement our existing low carbon dry powder inhalers.

It sets out how we approach action on nature through four focus areas – freshwater, land, oceans and atmosphere – including the biodiversity of living species across these areas.1 We aim to deliver our contribution in three ways: avoiding or reducing our impact on nature, protecting and restoring nature, and helping to accelerate collaborative action. This approach is aligned with the work of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Science Based Target Network (SBTN). The overuse of natural resources and the generation of waste and pollution are key drivers of nature loss, so we have also set underlying targets on waste and materials. In May 2023, we were selected to be part of the first group of companies to participate in the initial target validation process with SBTN to set validated science-based targets for nature, starting with targets for freshwater and land, followed by targets for oceans and biodiversity. These targets will focus on locations across our value chain where nature is particularly under pressure. TNFD published its final framework in September – an outcome of the pilot framework that we and others were already testing. We announced our commitment to adopting TNFD-aligned disclosures in 2026, based on 2025 data. We have already started to implement the final recommendations in our 2023 disclosure on page 70 of the Annual Report. gsk.com: Our plan for contributing to a nature positive world Freshwater We continue to work towards our existing water targets (set out below) and, as part of the SBTN pilot, we are currently working to implement their guidance and validate our freshwater targets.

We have implemented water efficiency and reuse systems at a number of our sites, including Pakistan, which is increasing its recycled water capacity. At our Wavre site in Belgium, a pilot wastewater treatment station has been installed to enable reuse of our wastewater to reduce water consumption. For our sites and key suppliers located in water-stressed areas, we are developing catchment-level water replenishment, restoration and regeneration projects to deliver our water neutrality target. We have partnered with a local NGO, Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR), in Nashik, India on a water replenishment project designed to improve ecosystem conditions, enhance the climate resilience of local agriculture, and help local villages manage water resources to improve their health and livelihoods. We are also a founding partner of the Women + Water Collaborative in India, which launched in October 2023, working with the Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative between the UN Global Compact and the Pacific Institute. This programme brings together companies from different sectors to leverage women’s leadership to improve access to clean water and sanitation, ultimately supporting the health of local communities.

Our primary dependency on land is through the natural materials we source, some of which derive from agricultural commodities. Their production can drive deforestation and land-use change. During 2023, we completed baseline assessments for six sites, meaning we have now assessed all our sites, using the Natural England Biodiversity Net Positive methodology. In parallel, we have plans in place to improve biodiversity at nine of our sites, an increase of six from 2022. In May 2023, we set out ambitious new Sustainable Sourcing Standards for suppliers who provide us with materials that are highly dependent on nature, like lactose, gelatine and soy. The standards, developed in collaboration with third-party experts, aim to support these suppliers to assess, improve and verify their approach to addressing a range of nature impacts – and associated climate and social impacts – including land-use, water stewardship and biodiversity. We have roadmaps in place which aim to achieve 100% sustainably-sourced paper packaging and palm oil by 2025. In 2023, 86% of our paper packaging was derived from certified sources or from recycled raw materials and 98% of our core palm oil materials were certified by third parties as being from sustainable sources. To further improve our Palm Oil sourcing practices, we have joined Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an industry-led collaboration to tackle environmental and social supply chain issues around palm oil derivatives. While working with suppliers is a key part of our goal to reduce our impact on nature, where appropriate we will also look at opportunities to reduce or avoid the use of some natural materials, for example through process efficiencies and synthetic alternatives. For example, an extract from the soapbark tree is an essential ingredient in vaccine adjuvants, which are used to enhance the immune response of vaccines. We are working on a process improvement to deliver a significant yield increase, reducing our nature impact and improving supply resilience. gsk.com: Our approach to sourcing materials that are highly dependent on nature Oceans We continue to deliver on our existing ocean target (set out below), and will apply the relevant science-based methodology on oceans when it becomes available.

Our new Sustainable Sourcing Standards, discussed above, include a specific Marine Sustainable Sourcing Standard which outlines the requirements that our suppliers of marine-derived materials must adhere to. We conducted physical site audits of key suppliers in 2023 to understand adoption of this standard. Atmosphere Air quality is closely linked to climate change, as many of the drivers of air pollution, such as burning fossil fuels, are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution is a significant risk to human health, particularly for patients with respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. Our approach to air pollution includes reducing pollutants linked to burning fossil fuels that will be addressed via our SBTi-aligned climate targets (set out on page 18), as well as looking more broadly at our air pollution footprint. To help accelerate collective action on air pollution, we are members of the Alliance for Clean Air through the Clean Air Fund (CAF) and the World Economic Forum, which aims to drive corporate action on clean air to accelerate climate action and create healthy communities around the world. We have done an initial assessment to establish an air pollution footprint in our operations and our supply chain. This highlighted opportunities for reductions in emissions linked to on-site electricity generation and use of solid fuels, car use and move to electric fleet, as well as indicating opportunities in our value chain for the sourcing of plastic and glass products. We are creating reduction plans around these key areas that are aligned to our pathway to zero and which aim to have a positive impact on air quality. We are conducting an additional air quality assessment, working with Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the University of York, broadening the suite of air pollutants to be taken into consideration to understand their impact across our value chain and their connection to human health. 1 Including a 20% reduction in"

Targets Our approach to product stewardship means that we consider and aim to address impacts on nature and climate at every stage of the product life cycle, from discovery, design, sourcing and manufacturing through to product use and disposal. We have set a target to help accelerate the adoption of this approach: –25% environmental impact reduction for our products and packaging by 2030 We have also set targets to reduce operational and supply chain waste: –Zero operational waste,1 including eliminating single-use plastics2 by 2030 –10% waste reduction from our supply chain by 2030 Product stewardship Our approach to product stewardship across both new and existing products is built on a scientific method for environmental footprinting called life cycle assessment (LCA). We worked with external specialists to co-develop an internal product carbon footprinting tool, building on the LCA process, that covers both climate and nature to inform our scientists and engineers when they develop new products. We also use publicly available tools when we need to share information outside of GSK. To embed sustainability into the design of all our future products, we have developed a set of eco-design principles to help guide the decision-making. We are actively working as part of a consortium of eight global pharmaceutical that have come together via the Pharmaceutical Environment Group (PEG), with support from the SMI, to co- develop a shared way of measuring and reporting environmental product data. Since 2022, we have completed an LCA analysis for 22 products, which has enabled us to identify where we need to improve manufacturing design, to assess potential savings from design changes and to provide product-level information to key customers on specific products. 100% of GSK sites are now manufacturing PVC-free secondary and tertiary packaging. We also implemented our first pilot of electronic patient information, to replace paper leaflets in Singapore. A solvent reduction strategy is being rolled out across our sites and key suppliers. This includes designing out solvents, using lower impact solvents, and improving solvent recovery rates. Waste In 2023, we reduced operational waste by 1% compared with 2022, a total of 21% since 2020.1 We increased the amount of materials recovered by circular routes to 53%. We have maintained zero operational waste to landfill and we continue to build on our long-standing operational waste management programme to identify opportunities to find more beneficial uses for waste. For example, at our wastewater treatment facility in Jurong and at our site in Marburg, Germany, we are reducing the amount of waste incinerated.

Investing in nature Investing in nature protection and restoration is a key part of our ambition and commitment to achieve a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet. We aim to do this by making investments in nature across our value chain. We are also prioritising nature investments for the carbon credits we are committed to securing as part of our pathway to net zero emissions. Our approach is to partner with expert developers, investors and NGOs to invest in early-stage nature projects for the long term. GSK is an investor in Climate Asset Management’s Nature Based Carbon Fund, which aims to invest at a landscape scale in grassland, agriculture, forestry, wetlands and coastal carbon projects in developing economies, to provide long-lasting, verified, positive impact at scale for the climate, biodiversity and local communities. This is a long-term investment over the next 15 years, which aims to secure approximately a quarter of credits that we need in 2030, to meet our commitment to invest in nature-based solutions for 20% of our 2020 footprint. To help ensure that human health is a key outcome of the world’s drive to protect and restore nature, in September 2023, we published an open-source toolkit in partnership with Pollination, developed with input from key nature and health experts from organisations such as the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance, the Nature Climate Solutions Alliance and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The toolkit aims to support companies, investors and developers to incorporate health considerations in the design of nature-based projects.

We want better health outcomes for all. Our clinical trials need to reflect the populations affected by the diseases we are aiming to address. Backed by the latest scientific research, we are working to make sure we recruit participants to our clinical trials in line with the epidemiology of the diseases in question. Being an inclusive business will make the most of our people’s potential and increase our positive impact. Our culture should allow all our people to thrive, we want all our leadership to reflect our GSK people and our people to reflect the communities we work and hire in. Diversity brings better insights and better-quality decision- making to help us perform better and understand our diverse patients. We want a truly inclusive working environment where all employees can be themselves and their diverse perspectives and characteristics are valued so they can thrive, perform at their best and help us get ahead of disease together. To build a diverse workforce, we need a diverse pool of job applicants – so we are working to improve access to STEM education among under-represented communities. These efforts extend from community programmes and secondary education, through working with universities to mentoring young people beginning their careers. Clinical trial diversity Diseases and medicines can affect people differently depending on ethnicity, sex, race and age. This means it is important to ensure that the patients and people enrolled in our clinical trials represent the real-world patient/people population that will use our medicines and vaccines and represent those affected by the disease under study. We continue to make progress in advancing clinical trial diversity. In addition to ensuring 100% of our phase III trials have diversity plans in place to enrol the groups most affected by the disease being studied, based on disease epidemiology, we also are challenging ourselves to actively monitor patient recruitment in real time to ensure that we reach our diversity goals. We met our objective of 100% of the phase III interventional trials initiated in 2023 having proactive diversity plans. In February 2023, we published a study of 17 years of GSK and ViiV Healthcare US clinical trial diversity data. It showed that enrolling participants to clinical trials based on real-world disease epidemiology data, rather than census data, would ensure that those trials reflect the populations affected by different diseases. As an example, US Census Bureau data indicates 13.4% of the total US population is Black/African American. However, epidemiology shows us that of HIV patients recently diagnosed in the US, 55.3% are Black/African American. We are using epidemiologic data to guide enrolment in our clinical trials, allowing us to set more representative trial enrolment goals.

Supporting diversity in our supply chains By engaging with and mentoring small and diverse-owned businesses in our supply chain, we can help them identify potential areas for growth. In 2023, we increased investments with select suppliers in marketing, sales and technology. In addition, we significantly increased partnerships with external advocacy groups, deepened relationships with key existing diverse suppliers, and onboarded new diverse suppliers. This year, we expanded our successful US supplier diversity programme to the UK. This programme provides opportunities to under-represented groups, including women, ethnic minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and military veterans, as well as small businesses in high- unemployment, low-income communities. Supporting an inclusive culture Our Code requires all our people to commit to being inclusive and aware of their impact on others. Our annual mandatory training on Creating an Inclusive Workplace sets out the standards we expect. gsk.com: The Code Building a diverse organisation We are fundamentally committed to equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination for all employees and we want all our leadership to reflect our GSK people and our people to reflect the communities we work and hire in. That is why we have set leadership aspirations for race and ethnicity in senior positions in the US and UK and gender aspirations for senior positions globally. To support this, we ensure that our recruitment and selection processes are fair and equitable to all. For vacancies in our senior grades, we expect diverse shortlists and interview panels by gender and ethnicity. We are working with recruitment agencies, our internal Employee Resource Groups and specialist organisations to drive progress. Hiring managers are required to complete inclusive interview training before they start selection processes. At the end of 2023, women held 45% of VP-and-above roles globally, compared with 42% in 2022. Women made up 48% of all employees in 2023, and 50% of all management roles.

We are now developing a new three-year plan to further improve how we meet the needs of people with disabilities. We are taking the needs of all our people into account by using our own Inclusive Design Standards for all new and retrofitted facilities, including our new global headquarters in London. These standards aim to ensure that our workplaces are welcoming to all our people. We have also partnered with PurpleSpace to sponsor a series of ‘Confident Conversation’ guides, available to all. These guides are a resource for people with disabilities and health conditions to help build confidence and personal resilience. They are also useful for colleagues, managers and leaders to learn more about how to support employees with disabilities and health conditions. Additionally, Disability Confidence training has been added into our First Line Leader training, aimed at all our people managers. This training is designed to develop inclusive leaders that are able to promote disability confidence within their teams. We continue to work to make sure that our LGBTQ+ colleagues feel welcome, valued and included. We were once more recognised as a Gold employer within Stonewall’s Top Global Employers Index. This year, we relaunched our Mental Health Matters training. Available globally, it is designed to help our people spot the signs of poor mental health, know how to start a conversation with others, and signpost resources to support everyone’s wellbeing. Supporting diverse innovators for the future We’re investing in STEM education to make it more equitable and to support and inspire the next generation of diverse, talented innovators. Our GSK Science in the Summer™ initiative offers free, hands-on STEM learning in community settings to students in the US from groups traditionally under-represented in STEM careers, or from under-resourced communities. It has reached more than 380,000 children across the US since its launch in 1986. In 2020, we committed $10 million over 10 years to support the number of women and Black and Latinx students in Philadelphia entering STEM careers. More than 138,000 students of all backgrounds have benefited from GSK STEM equity grants provided to local non-profit organisations so far. In the UK, we launched a £6 million, 10-year STEM equity programme, targeting 11–25-year-old girls and young women, black people and people from low socio-economic backgrounds. The programme includes nationwide STEM mentoring, delivered in partnership with established mentoring organisations. In its first three years, we aim to reach approximately 4,000 young people through this programme. 2020 2021 2022 2023 Gender diversity1 % of women (all employees) 47% 47% 47% 48% A SVP/VP level 38% 40% 42% 45% PR A Director level 46% 48% 49% 50% A Manager level 50% 50% 51% 51% A Total women in management 48%"

This builds trust in what we do, protects our business and helps create a workplace where we all thrive. How we do things is as important as what we do. Our Code of Conduct (The Code) reflects our purpose to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together. It sets out the commitments we make as a company and to each other to deliver on our purpose and ambition. The Code is supported by additional global policies and standards, which can be found in our Code Hub. We have an accompanying global mandatory learning curriculum, Living our Code, which all our people are required to complete, comprising three modules: The Code, Creating an Inclusive Workplace and Protecting GSK. Protecting GSK focuses on key areas such as anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC), information and cyber security, privacy, reporting human safety information related to our products, and our Speak Up integrity lines. In 2023, 100% of our employees and 99% of complementary workers completed this training where due by year end. We have additional ABAC training for our people in certain high-risk roles or geographic regions. This helps them identify and mitigate any potential ABAC risk – especially in third-party relationships – and recognise, report and manage conflicts of interest. In 2023, 100% of employees and 99% of complementary workers completed this training where due by year end. Our approach to managing ABAC risk, and other risks relating to ethical standards, forms part of our well-embedded risk management framework, which is described in detail in our Annual Report, on pages 57-61. gsk.com: Anti-bribery and corruption policy • The Code Reporting and investigating concerns Anyone inside or outside GSK can raise concerns or speak to our integrity lines, confidentially and anonymously, without fear of retaliation. We take every concern seriously and review every report to see whether we need to investigate formally. If our investigations show an employee has breached our policies, we take action. In 2023, we saw an overall decrease in the number of employees who had concerns raised against them, employees disciplined for policy violations and open cases at year end. This is reflective of several factors including external geopolitical and economic issues affecting some countries which changes the nature of concerns raised and, internally, our continued emphasis on appropriate management and closure of cases. Ethical standards Our culture guides our people to behave in an ethical way, to do the right thing and Speak Up about any concerns they have.

Our salient human rights relate to access to healthcare, research practices, patient safety, environment, health and safety (EHS), and privacy. We continue to make progress in integrating them within our operations and how we conduct our business. We are signatories to the UN Global Compact and our Human Rights Position Statement lays out our commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We have a cross-business Human Rights Steering Group, which reports to the GSK Leadership Team and Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee, and drives progress on human rights impacts and risks across the business. In 2023, we carried out human rights training for priority suppliers, aimed at ensuring a good understanding of human rights and labour principles, aligned with international standards. We also continued our human rights training for procurement and third- party engagement leads, to better equip them to spot human rights issues when visiting suppliers. We conduct audits and site visits covering EHS and labour rights for our priority suppliers.1 Some of the issues identified during supplier visits in 2023 related to policy, wages and compliance. All observations have action plans in place to drive improvement, which are tracked and followed up for completion. We are committed to fair and equitable pay, ensuring that all employees globally receive pay that is competitive in their local markets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living. In 2023, the Fair Wage Network certified GSK as a Living Wage employer, after it reviewed the global gap analysis we conducted in 2022. It confirmed that all GSK workers are paid at or above the living wage in their relevant markets. We have also developed a consistent approach to how GSK will manage global fair wage analysis annually, as well as a methodology for the Fair Wage Network to use to continue to assess us. gsk.com: Our position on Human Rights • Modern Slavery Act statement • Our position on working with third parties Working with third parties Our suppliers and other third parties – including agents, distributors and affiliate companies (where we have an equity stake) – help us research, develop, manufacture and distribute the medicines and vaccines that patients need.

All expectations are formalised in contracts and subject to appropriate levels of audit and oversight. All new suppliers undergo a risk assessment and all existing suppliers are re- assessed once every three years on average. Appropriate action is taken against those third parties found in breach of their undertakings. We assess all our third parties to understand whether we consider them to be low, medium or high risk. Our high-risk third parties are determined by location in high-risk markets, size of spend and type of goods or services. They are mostly goods and services providers (62%), distributors and wholesalers (3%), direct material suppliers (3%) and contract manufacturers (1%). In 2023, we assessed our high-risk third parties, totalling over 7,500 assessments across 17 risk areas. We also use tools to assess how suppliers manage risks, including EcoVadis desktop assessments. Additionally, to further support ongoing oversight of our third parties and suppliers, we have additional controls and monitoring programmes to ensure they meet our standards and requirements. For example, we include controls as relevant in our principal risks to manage third-party risk, which differs by business area according to the third-party risk profiles. Teams in our Global Supply Chain business are responsible for on-site supplier visits and audits, periodic business review and performance meetings, and annual or semi-annual enterprise- level governance.

We set EHS requirements and review performance as part of our internal EHS governance and oversight. We visit sites, in person or virtually, to help suppliers better understand and control their risks. This year, we conducted 73 physical visits across 63 priority suppliers.2 We conducted 47 supplier audits following industry standard Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative guidelines. We trained more than 1,000 supplier employees on EHS and ESG fundamentals this year, strengthened EHS contractual obligations and have worked with suppliers to help them improve their EcoVadis scores. We introduced a process to pause supply if a third party has a significant EHS incident, and the decision on whether to restart or discontinue work with the third party depends on completion of an improvement plan and trajectory. We also introduced an EHS risk app-based questionnaire for GSK visitors to a third party as part of our monitoring activities, which generate improvement actions that we track through to completion. gsk.com: Our position on working with third parties • Annual Report 2023 • Principal risks and uncertainties pages 230-240 Using data and AI responsibly Data is an essential foundation to realising our ambitions for patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies present tremendous opportunities, but the technologies must be approached correctly, responsibly and ethically. Increases in the volume of data processed through AI/ ML use have resulted in a greater focus on data governance and the ethical use of personal information, over and above compliance with data privacy laws. We take our responsibility for data privacy seriously and we exercise high standards of integrity in dealing with the personal information of our employees, patients, clinical research participants, healthcare providers and other stakeholders.

A Metric’s 2023 data has been independently assured. 1 In 2023, we enhanced our analytics of types of discipline taken and identified additional cases from prior years where disciplinary action was not reported. As a result, we restated some prior years metrics with the following net increase changes in employees disciplined for policy violations from prior reporting: 2020 (1); 2021 (3) and 2022 (3). Disciplinary action was taken within the year. 2 In 2022, we updated the reporting methodology for the breakdown of types of policy violation to provide more granularity by case class as there was a broader distribution from the top five policy area categories historically reported under 'other'. To enable comparison, prior year data has been restated using the new reporting methodology. 3 In 2022, we changed our process for the circumstances that trigger discipline for late completion of mandatory training, now reported under employee conduct. As a result, we saw fewer disciplinary cases in 2022 compared to prior years. 4 In 2023 changes from prior years are reflective of several factors including external geopolitical and economic issues affecting some countries which changes the nature of concerns raised and, internally, our continued emphasis on appropriate management and closure of cases, correlating in an increase in these areas. 5 In 2023, policy violation class type name changed from Computer and data-breach security to Cyber Security, content/classification remains the same and therefore data is comparable year on year. 6 The majority of EHS and sustainability category increases in 2022 were written warnings related to compliance with the company's COVID-19 vaccination mandate, safety or testing requirements, to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce, which were subsequently lifted in April 2023, correlating in a decrease in 2023. 7 These figures are based on active employees and complementary workers at year end. Data from 2020-21 is split between employees and complementary workers, as disclosed in our prior ESG reports, and rounded to the nearest whole number. 2020-21 also includes data from our previous Consumer Healthcare business; due to attrition over the last three years, restating completion rates would not provide a comparable metric. 8 In 2022, we updated the way in which we report completion of mandatory training by combining metrics for employees and complementary workers across the mandatory trainings into a single metric, rounded to the nearest whole number.Ethical standards continuedEthical standards continued 2020 2021 2022 2023 Ethical conduct1 Employees who had concerns raised against them (including current year and prior year open cases)2,105 2,534 2,191 1,960 A Employees disciplined for policy violations 553 910 850 798 A Breakdown of types of policy violation2 Employee conduct3268 555 367 304 A Sales and marketing 63 166 168 122 A Product quality 85 65 48 76 A Safeguarding people and information and assets 60 78 140 177 A Employee relations and HR policies 18 20 42 994 A R&D and medical practices 7 13 13"

We have systems in place across the company that ensure we meet the high standards we set ourselves, and those that are expected of us externally. These systems enable us to deliver a safe and reliable supply of high-quality medicines and vaccines. When issues arise, our quality systems, in line with our values-driven culture, ensure they are responded to swiftly and transparently. Product governance To protect our patients, it is critically important to ensure the quality, safety and reliable supply of our products. 1 We consider any observations from the US FDA as major.Our commitment We commit to maintaining robust quality and safety processes, and using data and new technologies responsibly Our ESG Performance Rating metrics 2023 –Average number of critical and major findings per inspection by FDA/MHRA/EMA regulators1 –Percentage of inspections from all regulators with no critical findings or official action indicated –Number of FDA warning letters –Total number of Class I/II external product recalls across all markets –Register and disclose all human subject research of GSK products. Specifically, register protocol summaries for studies initiated in 2023; and disclose results summaries for studies with results due in 2023 Maintaining quality across GSK We have a detailed and specific quality framework that describes how we comply with regulatory requirements and other standards across our markets. This addresses global and local regulations across manufacturing and distribution processes, and is based on principles defined by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Our GSK quality function is responsible for managing quality and for ensuring a quality mindset is embedded throughout the organisation at all levels. It brings together an extensive global network of quality and compliance professionals within each of our business units, from site level to senior management. Our Quality Management System provides the standards required to be followed by GSK people to support good distribution and manufacturing practice and to maintain a standardised and compliant approach to all our quality activities, aligned to the regulatory expectations of the markets that we supply to. Inspections, recalls and audit We are subject to frequent regulatory inspections in markets where we supply our medicines and vaccines. These inspections provide independent assurance that our development, manufacturing and distribution processes adhere to the required high quality standards and expectations. We work to ensure we are inspection ready at all times. In 2023, we had 114 regulatory inspections at our manufacturing sites and local operating companies, compared with 122 in 2022. We received zero warning letters from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or critical findings from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2023. We respond to and learn from all inspection findings, taking the necessary actions to address them. Throughout 2023, we had two Class I product recalls. In these instances, we engaged with regulators and acted quickly to prioritise patient safety."

The materiality assessment is used to inform strategic decision- making and helps us to prioritise issues covered in public reporting. We used Datamaran’s data analytics platform to conduct the assessment. The software monitors external ESG risks by assessing the coverage of issues within peer annual and sustainability reports, regulatory and legislative documents, media and social media. We also conducted stakeholder engagement, through internal and external interviews and analysis of investor ratings, rankings and reports.Through this process, 16 issues were identified as most material to our business and our external stakeholders, illustrated in the matrix below. The issues identified through this process helped confirm our six ESG focus areas: Access, Global health and health security, Environment, Diversity, equity and inclusion, Ethical standards and Product governance.

KPI Definition Method Access Total community investment (£m) All donations made by GSK globally for charitable purposes including cash, product, in kind donations, the value of time donated via volunteering and the management costs associated with charitable programmes. Donations are only included if they are voluntary and charitable in purpose. Donations are valued in GBP at year end exchange rates. Product donations are valued at global average cost of goods as reported in year-end results. In-kind donations are valued at the value or cost of the item to GSK not the current external purchase price. Previous years’ data is included for comparison but not restated for inflation or exchange rate changes. The methodology used follows the B4SI (formerly LBG) Framework for Corporate Community Investment. Value of GSK medicine and vaccines provided through our US Patient Assistance Program (COGS in million USD) The value of medicine and vaccines provided through the GSK and ViiV Healthcare Patient Assistance Programs Foundation which provides medication at no charge to eligible individuals. Patients who receive medications through the Patient Assistance Programs must meet eligibility requirements. These requirements include insurance status, a financial component based on the Federal Poverty Level, being a resident of the US, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands and being treated by a US-licensed healthcare provider. The GSK and ViiV Patient Assistance Programs Foundation administers 13 Patient Assistance Programs for patients in the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. We capture Patient Assistance Program orders for GSK and ViiV Healthcare products through an internal ordering database. The data is captured according to the Wholesale Acquisition Cost of the medicine or vaccine and is coded as ‘Free Good Charitable Orders’. This amount is converted to a ‘Cost of Goods Sold’ amount for reporting purposes. Patient participation varies annually based on current program eligibility criteria, overall healthcare environmental factors and products included in the programs. Doses of Rotarix , Synflorix and Cervarix vaccines supplied to Gavi (millions) The number of doses of the Rotarix , Synflorix and Cervarix vaccine that are supplied to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries. GSK has been a Gavi supplier since Gavi’s inception in 2000. Doses of Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) vaccines supplied (millions)The number of doses of the Mosquirix (RTS,S/ AS01 E) vaccine GSK donated to the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) and number of Gavi funded doses supplied through Gavi-Unicef To calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK doses procured by UNICEF for MVIP and Gavi funded supply. GSK has supplied/donated 10 million Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E), since the beginning of the MVIP in 2019 and has supplied the first Gavi funded doses from Q4-2023.

As a chronic and ongoing treatment, we capture the cumulative number of people with access to dolutegravir, rather than annual data, to avoid duplication. The indicator therefore represents the total number of people living with HIV accessing the treatment at the time of measurement. As a life-long treatment, this number incorporates people that have been receiving ongoing treatment for multiple years. For adults living with HIV, the number is calculated by adding the total number of packs of all generic dolutegravir-based products (indicated for adults) sold over the previous four quarters. This is then divided by twelve to obtain average monthly sales and estimate the number of adults on treatment. For children living with HIV, this is done by calculating the total number of paediatric DTG 10mg tablets sold over the previous four quarters and dividing this by 365 to calculate average number of tablets sold per day. This is then divided by 2.056 (the average daily number of tablets taken across different paediatric weight bands) to estimate the number of children on treatment. In both cases, packs of 90 and 60 are converted to 30 pack equivalents (i.e. monthly equivalents for a daily treatment). Data is provided by the Medicines Patent Pool and Aurobindo, through which ViiV’s DTG patents are (sub-)licensed. Our approach Access Global health Environment"

All children receiving Synflorix are under five years of age.To calculate the estimated number of children reached, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries, and divide this by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule, with Gavi estimated vaccine wastage rates factored in. For Synflorix a full schedule is three doses, and Gavi estimates wastage of 10% in 2017 and 2018, 8% in 2019-2023.

Priority WHO diseases are defined as diseases and pathogens prioritized for R&D in public health emergency contexts, which distinguishes diseases to the degree they pose the greatest public health risk due to their epidemic potential and/or whether there is no or insufficient countermeasures. GSK uses the following lists: –WHO Priority Pathogen List* –WHO Emergency Diseases List* –WHO Blueprint for Prioritized Disease List* –WHO Essential Medicines List* –UN Sustainable Development Goals * WHO reviews and updates these lists as needs arise and methodologies change. ‘Pipeline progression’ is defined as the movement of a Global Health asset from one phase to another. GSK recognises progression through the following four categories: –Senior leadership endorsement of business plan for progression –Clinical trial starts (‘First Subject, First Visit/Dose’) –Business development/in-licensing –Regulatory milestone (ie – submission, approval, or launch) 2023 ESG achievements consider GSK’s internal 2-week grace period to ensure that any asset progressed through 15 January will not be double counted for the metric in 2024.

The question is included in the Annual Engagement and Culture Survey which is sent annually. The survey is issued to all regular full-time and fixed term contract employees in all countries in which GSK operates (excluding Russia due to the sanctions). Questions are translated by professional service partners into 23 languages (excluding English). In 2023, the “Annual Engagement and Culture Survey” replaced the quarterly Pulse surveys, therefore the percentage of employees for this metric is the result of a single annual data point instead of an average score across quarterly surveys. 80% of direct high-risk suppliers achieve GSK’s minimum EcoVadis score or have an improvement plan in placeDirect high-risk suppliers are identified on a yearly basis through a combination of spend, category and high-risk countries. Direct procurement involves the purchasing of materials directly associated with the production of goods. Out of the total number of 4,414 direct suppliers, 122 are high-risk and managed through GSK’s EcoVadis Programme. An improvement plan in place is defined as an ongoing improvement plan. GSK requires suppliers to have a minimum EcoVadis score of 45.Through our EcoVadis Programme, we work with direct high-risk suppliers to help them improve their operations and support their sustainability journey. EcoVadis is an external ratings provider and assesses organisations across four themes: Environment & Community, Labour & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. A supplier may not have an improvement plan in place because the assessment is in progress, the supplier has committed to participate in the programme but hasn’t commenced yet or the supplier hasn’t accepted the improvement plan. Where the improvement plan has been implemented and the supplier awaits reassessment to reflect improved score, this is reported as the supplier not having an improvement plan in place. An improvement plan is initiated by the supplier or any of its partners, including GSK, and tracked on the EcoVadis platform. Where required, GSK interacts directly with the supplier to ensure corrective actions are implemented. EcoVadis scorecard data is exported from the EcoVadis platform. Direct high-risk suppliers are identified on a yearly basis through a combination of spend, category and high-risk countries. Direct procurement involves the urchasing of material directly associated with the production of goods.

FDA product recalls by business and classThe number of US FDA recalls of product from the US market. We categorise the data according to which of our businesses it relates to (pharmaceutical or vaccine) and according to recall type. Business units track recall data in an electronic system. Publicly available trial protocol summaries (register) and result summaries (disclose) The number of trial protocol summaries registered and results summaries disclosed on the external facing GSK trial register or ViiV register as part of GSK’s internal policy commitment to disclosure of human subject research. This is in addition to the mandatory requirements by regulators for disclosure of protocol registrations. Studies for which protocol summaries were registered on the GSK trial register (www.gsk-studyregister.com) or on ViiV register (www.viiv- studyregister.com). The numbers represent the studies which were initiated in the current year for which protocol summaries were registered. For cumulative values: The numbers represent the studies for which protocol summaries were registered on the GSK register between 2004 and 2023; and those registered on ViiV study register between 2009 and 2023. These numbers are generated through the Transparency report which derives the data from the disclosure system used by the business. People disclosures Overall turnover (%) Overall turnover is a measure of GSK employees leaving GSK and does not include internal moves within GSK.We calculate the number of leavers during the year as a percentage of the average reporting year’s permanent headcount. The employee turnover rate includes employees who left the company both voluntarily and involuntarily during the year. The data is updated daily and extracted from our GSK-wide HR platform. The data is based on the effective date of termination and not the termination date. The termination date is the last day of work and the effective date of termination is the first day of termination, ie the following day. Therefore, employees with termination dates of 31 December of reporting year are not included in this dataset. “Reportable” injury or illnessA GSK reportable injury or illness meets the following criteria: 1.

Our Conclusion : On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Selected Information is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. This conclusion relates only to the Selected Information, and is to be read in the context of this Independent Limited Assurance Report, in particular the inherent limitations explained overleaf. Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to GSK’s Management . These observations do not affect our conclusion set out above. Selected Information The scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the metrics included within the Report for the current reporting year (th e “Selected Information”), listed below and in the Appendix: •The Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) performance data listed in the Appendix of this document. •The overall 2023 ESG Performance Rating score of “on track” relating to GSK’s performance against the 2023 Performance Rating metrics listed on pages 6 and 7 of the Report. To assess the Selected Information, which includes an assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Report, we have used GSK’s ESG Data Collection Process and Controls Documents which are summarised in the ESG reporting criteria (the “Criteria”), which can be found from pages 47 to 54 of the Report. We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Repo rt or on GSK’s website for the current reporting period or for previous periods. Standard and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement of specified data and information using DNV’s assurance methodology VerisustainTM, which is based on our professional experience and international assurance best practice including the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 – ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ (revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This methodology ensures compliance with ethical requirements and mandates planning and execution of the assurance engagement to obtain a limited level of assurance. DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, which are based on the principles enclosed within ISO IEC 17029:2019 - Conformity Assessment - General principles and requirements for validation and verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and are shorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance"

DNV established policies and procedures are designed to ensure that DNV, its personnel and, where applicable, others are subject to independence requirements (including personnel of other entities of DNV) and maintain independence where required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. DNV did not provide any services to GSK in 2023 that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our work. Our multi - disciplinary team consisted of professionals with a combination of environmental and sustainability assurance experience.Our competence, independence and quality control"

    "text": "Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 20248 Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex Glossary Stakeholders’ letterDear Readers, As a pioneer, Swisscom drives forward digital innovation and shapes Switzerland’s progress. This self-image is a fundamental part of our corporate strategy and is also reflected in our sus - tainability effort, which has been recognised internationally: the renowned Time magazine and the data company Statista included us in their first published list of the ‘World’s Most Sus - tainable Companies 2024’. For us, this is an incentive to continue on the path we have cho - sen. In view of global challenges, especially the net-zero emis - sions target, we are committed to promoting new technologies that promise to help with the achievement. As a whole Group, we have set ourselves a net-zero target for 2035, in line with the SBTi across our entire value chain. In 2024, we made significant progress on various initiatives, such as improving our energy efficiency, electrifying our fleet, upgrading oil heating systems and supporting suppliers with CO2 reduction programmes.New ways of protecting the climate In the future, we will go even further and move towards an approach that can be described as ‘beyond value chain mitigation’. This means that firstly, as a pioneer, we will promote start-ups and technologies that contribute to the removal of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere because the entire economy will inevita - bly depend on such technologies to achieve net-zero. Secondly, we want to promote climate change mitigation in addition to prior - itising the reduction of emissions, even outside of our own value chain. We already do this today to some extent. For example, our cus - tomers are avoiding emissions thanks to their use of our ICT services. By 2025, we aim to save one million tonnes of CO2 per year in this way. Or with our Sustainability Software Radar launched in 2024 in cooperation with Atlantic Ventures, which supports ESG managers in selecting tools, thus helping Swiss companies with the implementation of holistic and data-based sustainability and carbon management. Responsible use of artificial intelligence By using artificial intelligence (AI) and automating processes, we are systematically making use of the technological opportuni - ties of the future internally within the Group. There will also be solutions based on generative AI for our customers in the future – and that is precisely why we are taking responsibility for its ‘proper’ use as a leading ICT provider. Since the reporting year, we have done this by giving all our employees mandatory training on ethical questions through e-learning. And by offering a new, interactive guide on our public learning platform Swisscom Campus to raise awareness of the opportunities and risks of using AI.

We believe that innovation and sustainability go hand in hand and that we as a company must remain agile. For this reason, we also revised and further developed our sustainability strategy during the year under review. It has only been in force since the start of 2025, and you can find a short preview in this report.

    "text": "Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 202412 Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex Glossary The Swisscom fleet is going electric Insights in an ongoing project In 2021, we started off with 80 e-vehicles. Today, half of our fleet is already electric. In the reporting year, we ordered 1,200 new e-cars – a mammoth project and an important milestone on the journey to full fleet electrification by 2030. Michael Klasa, who is responsible for mobil - ity at Swisscom, has the details. Why does Swisscom need so many vehicles anyway? To get straight to the point: every vehicle at Swisscom is opera - tionally necessary. Passenger cars help our service technicians quickly get to the customer when necessary. Commercial vehicles are primarily used in expanding our network infrastructure. In addition, we use off-road vehicles to ensure that we can main - tain Swisscom antennas in mountain regions too. What are the most important lessons from a change of this size? It sounds simple, but it’s true: the key to success is communication. The Group Executive Board’s clear commitment to making the switch was important. This backing meant we were able to trans -parently provide clear information internally from the start, in particular to the people who use the vehicles: the drivers. They therefore knew from an early stage, for example, which vehicles they were getting. Their support was and is very impor - tant to us. Charging infrastructure is a challenge. How are we ensuring that our employees’ vehicles don’t grind to a halt while they’re driving them? Driving data analyses and driver surveys have given us a good picture of who can access which type of charging infrastructure. We currently rely on the public network of charging stations, as this is how we are best able to ensure that all our drivers can charge their vehicle. At the same time, we’re adding charging infrastructure to our own locations, e.g. telephone exchanges, and providing financial support for installing a charging station at home. To date, no one has yet run out of power in their e-vehicle, which makes us optimistic that our thinking and assessments weren’t entirely wrong ((laughs)). What concrete contribution does electrifying the vehicles fleet make to achieving our net-zero target in 2035? Our vehicles fleet is responsible for half of our direct CO2 emis - sions. The planned complete changeover to electric mobility from 2030 will reduce our fleet’s Scope 1 emissions to net-zero, so the contribution to the net-zero target is quite significant. Hand on heart, how are the new vehicles going down with the drivers? I’m not exaggerating when I say that the new vehicles have been a real hit. For me, this shows that driving an electric car isn’t just sustainable, it’s fun, too.Interview with: Michael Klasa Head of Mobility"

It is entitled ‘Responsibility means moving forward – now, not someday’. We want to take a leading role and actively address the challenges, however large and complex they may be. Follow - ing J ESG logic, the strategy can be divided into three areas: 1. Responsibility for the environment We want to make a positive contribution besides our reduction targets by reducing CO2 emissions beyond our value chain. Our entire Group has committed itself to the long-term goal of achieving J net-zero in 2035 in accordance with J SBTi . 2. Responsibility for people We want to provide inspiring workplaces and open up the digital future to everyone. 3. Responsibility in actions We want to stand up for the highest standards as a trustwor - thy partner. In these three areas, we differentiate our goals according to their impact either within or outside the company, e.g. with our customers. In implementing our sustainability strategy, we are committed to transparency and dialogue with the public. An overview of the achievement status can be found in the table of targets. Responsibility for the environment To help limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, we want a 90% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 1990 and a 50% reduction of Scope 3 emissions compared to 2013 by 2025 and, together with our customers, save one million tonnes of CO2 per year. Increase energy efficiency and continue to use 100% renewable electricity: fresh air cooling for fixed and mobile networks, electrification of the vehicle fleet Reduce CO2 emissions in the value chain: carbon reduction programme with suppliers, circular proprietary products Develop a circular economy with second-life programmes: Mobile Aid promotes the longevity of devices and closes resource loops Avoid CO2 emissions with our customers: comprehensive B2B support on the path to net-zeroResponsibility for people In 2025, we will support two million people a year in the use of digital media and thus open up the digital world to everyone.

Every one to two years, we identify the sustainability issues in this network of relationships that are considered relevant or very relevant for our stakeholders and for us. This ensures that the strategic focus of our work for us and our environment is consistent and in line with current develop - ments. This publication contains detailed information, facts and figures on all material issues. Determining and reviewing the material issues In 2022, we carried out several analyses as part of the revision of the Sustainability Strategy 2025 – which builds the base of this report – as well as a benchmark to determine and review the material issues. Internal and external stakeholders were involved in this process. Details on how the material issues were deter - mined are described in the Sustainability Report 2022. Ywww.swisscom.ch/cr-report2022 Slight adjustments 2024 In the year under review, we conducted several analyses for the development of our new ESG Strategy 2030, including bench - marking and trend analyses. We also conducted stakeholder interviews and, as part of the strategy development process, we also carried out an internal reweighting of the topics with the top management. Based on all these internal and external anal - yses, we can derive a few selective adjustments to the key top - ics for 2024. Corporate and data ethics will be weighted slightly more heavily. For the first time, climate risks must be reported in accordance with TCFD on a group level. This gives the topic greater significance . It is from now on reported in the Annual Report. We continued to systematically maintain our stakeholder relationships in 2024 and made minor adjustments to individual material topics. In summary, for the year under review, we sharpened the focus on the impact of our activities on the economy, society and the environment. A fundamental and comprehensive revision will be carried out in connection with the new ESG Strategy 2030 and with the double materiality that is carried out to fulfil CSRD requirements. Selection criteria for the material issues The following criteria were decisive in determining the material issues: • Significance and relevance for our stakeholder groups • Importance of the topics in our norms and standards (vision, values, promise and code of conduct) • Impact of our activities on the topic area • Effects of the topics on the company’s financial position, results of operations and on our reputationCross-disciplinary project team Corporate responsibility and corpo - rate strategy Internal and external stakeholder groups From the Swiss core market Group Executive Board Committee Group Executive Board Board of DirectorsTrend analysis Recognising new trends and assess - ing their relevance for our own business activitiesBenchmarking Identifying topics and trends at ten leading telecoms/ ICT companies Materiality analysis Review selection and categorisation of issues Materiality matrix Authorisation Authorisation AuthorisationAnalysis of strengths and weaknesses Strength"

Reason enough to ask our Head of Sustainabil - ity, Saskia Günther, a few questions. Why is now the right time for a new sustainability strategy? As we face a rapidly changing world, it‘s vital that we remain adaptable and innovative. Regularly reviewing our measures, targets and focus areas is key to stay relevant and effective. For this reason, we have decided to further develop the current strategy and to align it with our Swisscom Group strategy. Our commitment builds the foundation of our vision to be a pioneer in sustainability by 2030. Can you give us a brief overview of the most important steps in the development of the strategy? Of course. To find out how we want to position ourselves in 2030, we performed a detailed trend analysis and a comparative benchmark study with other tech companies and well-known ESG leaders. These results from this study, combined with an analy - sis of our current strategy and discussions with stakeholders, helped us to shape the position of Swisscom Switzerland on the different ESG topics. In terms of new focuses, can you give us an idea of what is new? Sure, I can give you a first glimpse: the assessments show that we are currently leading in climate engagement, and to remain so, alongside our ambitious net-zero target, J Beyond Value Chain Mitigation will be part of our commitment in the future. We also recognise our responsibility for other natural issues, which is why we are increasing our focus on circular economy and including biodiversity targets in our strategy for the first time. Remaining an attractive employer of choice remains a prior - ity. We also intend to further strengthen our commitment to the protection of minors in the media. We also intend to further strengthen our commitment to the protection of minors in the media. Finally, we’ll have an even greater focus on security and ethics, and a stronger emphasis on the responsible use of new digital technologies and AI. So, you can really look forward to our new sustainability strategy.Interview with: Saskia Günther Head of Sustainability"

We maintain direct communication and dialogue with all stakeholder groups. Customers We systematically ask our customers directly and by means of qualitative and quantitative surveys about their needs, their satisfaction and their perception of Swisscom as a responsible company. Partners/NGOs We believe in the importance of sharing insights and information with partners and NGOs within the framework of projects. These include myclimate, WWF, the Kinderschutz Schweiz child protection foundation, the Association of Swiss Teachers (LCH), the Swiss Association of the Deaf, SOS Children’s Villages Switzer - land and organisations that address issues such as human rights in the supply chain. Ywww.swisscom.ch/cr-partnerships Investors and rating agencies In addition to the Annual General Meeting and the quarterly publication of results, we are in dialogue with our investors at investor conferences and roadshows. They expect us first and foremost to deliver attractive profitability with stable distributions, but increasingly also to comply with various sustainability standards. In the year under review, the number of enquiries about our approach to J ESG topics continued to increase. Accordingly, dialogue with rating agencies is also important to us.Authorities and legislators We engage in intensive dialogue with the authorities, political parties, associations and NGOs on political and regulatory issues and play a constructive role in the legislative process. One of the key topics here is the expansion of the J 5G network infra - structure, for example. HSee ‘Actor in public debates’ HSee ‘Mobile communications and society’ Suppliers Our procurement organisation is responsible for supplier man - agement. This includes risk analysis, the choice of supply part - ners, contracting and a dedicated supplier evaluation and devel - opment process. Agreements on objectives are formulated, fulfilment of services is reviewed, and ESG issues are also taken into account as standard. In order to achieve our ESG objectives, we keep an open dialogue with global suppliers. We also use the channel of international cooperation within relevant sectors, Joint Alliance for CSR – JAC.

In addition to the media office, our management also engages in regular dialogue with journalists. Ywww.swisscom.ch/news Public We maintain contact with the public via our website, through social media and surveys, at trade fairs and as part of events. Social partners Regular contact with our social partners is particularly important to us. Our social partners include syndicom (the union for media and communications) and transfair (the public service employee association). Both are the dialogue and negotiating partners for matters relevant to the CEA and strategic participation. Employees and employee representation Using a wide range of communication platforms and activities, we promote a corporate culture that encourages dialogue between the CEO and top management and our employees. For example, the CEO regularly answers employees’ questions in online ‘cof - fee talks’. Once a year, Swisscom’s employees can use a questionnaire to share their personal feelings and opinions about issues concerning the company’s organisation (response rate 2024: 75%). This survey allows the entire organisa - tion to respond to feedback and make improve ments. The employee association takes on board the requests, wishes and criticisms of employees and represents these in discussions with management. It is made up of 47 members, i.e. approximately one representative for every 400 employees. Employee concerns mainly relate to social partnership, personnel training and devel - opment, diversity, and health and safety in the workplace. HSee also ‘Employees’ Strategic goals of the Federal Council The Federal Council defines the goals that the Confederation, as our majority shareholder, aims to achieve in the next four years. During the current target period, which runs until 2025, it expects us to pursue a corporate strategy that is, to the extent economically possible, committed to sustainable and ethical principles. In this context, the reduction of greenhouse gas emis - sions is of particular importance. In addition, the strategy should take into account the concerns of the different parts of the country, where operationally appropriate.

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryEnergy Management approach Responsible use of energy is the key to a sus - tainable future. In a world increasingly shaped by scarcity of resources and climate change, we therefore face the challenge of constantly reducing our energy consumption and focus on renewable energy sources. In this section, we therefore place a particular focus on measures to reduce our energy con - sumption and the associated energy efficiency.As a major consumer of energy, we have been working hard to improve our energy efficiency for years. We operate the largest telecommunications and IT infrastructure in Switzerland and one of the largest fleets of company and commercial vehicles. Fur - thermore, we have heating and cooling consumption of our office and operations buildings, shops and data centres. For this reason, we have been concluding agreements on objec - tives with the J Energy Agency for Industry (EnAW) and the Confederation’s Exemplary Energy and Climate initiative since 2013. This has been a successful approach: since then, we have improved our energy efficiency by around 65.5% and thus meet our agreement on objectives for 2024. In the reporting year, we concluded a new target agreement with the EnAW for further 10 years to 2034 with the target of an energy efficiency increase by 30%. This applies to all energy sources, electricity, fuels and heating fuels. Our key tool for this is our energy management system, which is based on the ISO 50001 standard and is being implemented in parallel throughout the company through a large number of diverse measures. As a member of the energy-saving alliance of the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), to develop energy-saving measures that are quick to implement in order to guarantee Switzerland’s energy supply. Our energy consumption remains unchanged compared to the previous year, nevertheless, thanks to the measures implemented the energy efficiency increased. Our energy consumption has a major influence on our direct CO2 emissions and is therefore one of our most important tools on the way to achieving our J net-zero target in 2035.

The electrification of heating systems and vehicles is not mentioned in this chapter, as it primarily serves to reduce CO2 emissions in addition to increas - ing efficiency and is addressed in detail in the following section on climate. Electricity The network infrastructure accounts for around two thirds of our total electrical energy consumption. Despite our reduction measures, our electrical energy consumption increased in the reporting year especially in the mobile network due to the con - tinuous network expansion. Nevertheless, we saved approxi - mately 15.5 GWh (2023: 14.8 GWh) of energy using the follow - ing measures: • Use of latest generation antenna-integrated radio units (AIR) and modernisation of passive radio units and basebands in the mobile network. • Modernisation of racks, power supply units, backup batteries in mobile sites. • Activation of further software-saving features in the 4G and 5G radio access network (RAN). • Replacement of air conditioning systems with free cooling units: a further 600 mobile sites are to be modified by the end of 2026. • Switch to J fibre-optic networks (FTTH) and phaseout of old copper technology (FTTC, FTTB and FTTS). • Shutdown of older network and transport platforms and gen - eral space reductions in central offices (CO). • Innovative data centres with energy-efficient server and cloud infrastructure. • Highly virtualised server and clouds. • Energy-efficient data centre buildings with high PUE values. The power usage effectiveness (PUE) value represents the total power consumed by a data centre relative to the power consumed by the IT infrastructure used. In the year under review, our data centres had an average PUE value of 1.30. Our most innovative data centre is in Bern Wankdorf. It is cooled with circulating air and rainwater, and its waste heat flows into the heating network of the city of Bern. • Continuous savings and improvements in buildings, for example, through the systematic switch to LED lighting, operational optimisation measures and the implementation of smart solutions.Breakdown of total energy consumption in GWh 490 28 24 Electricity Heating fuel Vehicle fuel 542 1.34 1.34 1.31 1.30 PUE value trend Total electricity consumption of data centres in relation to power consumption of the IT infrastruc - ture used there 2022 2023 2024 2021 26 Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024"

Our objective is to take on a leading role in climate protection through innovative approaches.Our climate strategy is based on the J IPCC reports, which call for a tightening of the Paris climate target with a maximum temperature increase of 1.5°C. To this end, we are continuously and systematically reducing our CO2 emissions: as a Group, we are committed to achieving J net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain by 2035 in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative J SBTi . In doing so, we are com - mitted to reducing our absolute J Scope 1, 2 and 3 green - house gas emissions by 90% by 2035, as against our baseline year 2018 and neutralising the remaining maximum 10%.

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryScope 1 Our energy consumption remains the most important internal lever for reducing our direct CO2 emissions. We mainly use electricity to run our networks (fixed, mobile and broadcasting networks) and, to a much lower extent, energy for operational mobility and for heating our offices. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is particularly relevant for Scope 1 emissions. In the reporting year we were able to significantly reduce our Scope 1 emissions overall. In addition to the points already mentioned in the ‘Energy’ section, the following measures contribute to reducing our J Scope 1 emissions: • Replacement of fossil-fuelled heating systems Since 2016, we have been systematically replacing heating systems with climate friendly ones. The new heating systems generate heat by means of heat pumps, biomass (wood), district heating and, where possible, heat recovery from our own operations. In the reporting year, we replaced a total of 19 additional heating systems so that by the end of 2024, a total of 129 heating systems had been renovated. By 2035, all heating systems of our own buildings are to run in a cli - mate-friendly manner, thus reducing our direct emissions from heating to an absolute minimum. • Alternative solutions for emergency power systems In 2023, we successfully launched the Decarbonising Emer - gency Power pilot project to replace diesel heating fuel for an emergency power generator with HVO (hydrotreated vege - table oil). This could reduce CO2 emissions for the operation of emergency power generators by up to 90% in the future. • Procurement of eco-friendly heating oil As of 2020, we only purchase eco-friendly heating oil with a reduced sulphur content for our properties, which reduces CO2 emissions of heating systems still running on fossil fuels. • Reducing the impact of refrigerants on the climate We have set ourselves the target of reducing CO2 emissions due to refrigerant losses to zero by 2035. Since 2015, we have only used hydrofluoroolefins (HFO) with a global warming potential (GWP) of 1 wherever possible. We only use natural refrigerants for new installations. We will continue to actively pursue new technologies in the future and aim to completely replace all systems with a GWP > 6 by 2035 (with the exception of < 12 kW installations). Wherever possible, we cool using direct J free cooling ventilation. To improve efficiency in hot periods we additionally use rainwater for cooling purposes. • Use of waste heat Since several years, we have been committed to make use of our waste heat in the best possible way. We are continuously looking for further partnerships to reuse the waste heat through district heating networks and internal upgrades. • Electrification of our vehicle fleet We want to halve the direct emissions of our vehicle fleet between 2020 and 2025, and completely eliminate them by 2030. In addition to the various efficiency measures listed in the ‘Energy’ section, we will completely phase out the use of fossil fuel"

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryScope 2 We have been pursuing a ‘market-based’ approach for the non-re - newable portion of purchased electricity since 2010 and for district heating since 2019. In accordance with the GHG Proto - col J Scope 2 Guidance, we report Scope 2 emissions both before and after offsetting through renewable energy certificates (RECs) ( J location-based or market-based ). For electricity, we meet the quality criteria for RECs in accordance with ISO 14064 for energy. As there is no option of generating RECs for geothermal energy in the same country or within the market boundaries, we are unable to meet the quality criteria for the offsetting of district heating set out in the ISO 14064 standard in full in this respect. Nevertheless, we believe it is important to do our best to pro - mote renewable energies here too. The use of certified electricity and district heating reduces our CO2 emissions from electricity to the indirect emissions (provision of electricity and district heat - ing). The efficiency measures for our electrical energy consump - tion outlined in the ‘Energy’ section enabled us to avoid Scope 2 emissions overall. The following further measures mitigate our climate impact in Scope 2: • Use of 100% renewable electricity For the non-renewable portion of our electricity, we pur - chase RECs for renewably generated electricity, which contains mostly wind. Our J electricity mix thus comprises 100% renewable sources. • Use of renewable heat We have been purchasing renewable district heating since 2019 and continuously investigate new connections to the local district heating network wherever possible.• Electricity generation from our own PV systems We are building more PV systems on our buildings each year in order to continuously increase the proportion of our own production of renewable electricity. The electricity produced is consumed primarily by the company itself, while any sur - plus produced is channelled into the grid. We want to maxim - ise the available space to build PV systems and produce as much renewable electricity as possible. As a result, we commis - sioned 18 new systems in the reporting year alone. One of the challenges we face is the fact that we have to first assess all the roofs and renovate some of them before we can install PV, as some buildings are quite old.

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryScope 3 More than 95% of our emissions are attributable to our indirect emissions in Scope 3. Accordingly, the greatest leverage for decar - bonisation lies in our upstream and downstream value chains. Our indirect emissions can be categorised into three main areas: supply chain, employee mobility and circular economy, where we also focus our CO2 reduction measures. In the reporting year, our J Scope 3 emissions increased by 4.5%. This increase is mainly due to two factors: on the one hand, key suppliers recorded an increase in their emissions, in some cases due to recalcula - tions of their GHG inventory. On the other hand, we procured more goods and services from suppliers with a high emission-inten - sity per CHF spent. However, we are pursuing a medium to long- term strategy for reducing the emissions in our supply chain and are convinced that we will decrease these emissions in line with our climate targets in the coming years. CO2 emissions in our supply chain Every year, we purchase CO2-relevant goods and services worth over CHF 3.4 billion. In total, we work with over 3,000 suppliers in more than 150 commodity groups. Two thirds of our indirect emissions in the value chain are generated in the production and delivery of the network infrastructure, IT, merchandise and services we purchase. Our procurement team ensures compliance with procurement regulations and due diligence. It is attached to the Group Business Steering division and is therefore the responsibility of the CFO. We rely on cooperation and collaboration with suppliers and international telecom peers to accelerate the transformation. Scaling our efforts through the JAC industry alliance means we are excellently positioned to accelerate changes in the global ICT industry.Mitigating the effects of climate change can only be achieved through long-term collaboration. That’s why, along with other telecoms providers, we are an active member of J JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR). True to the motto ‘Cooperation beyond competi - tion’, we are working together as an industry to decarbonise supply chains. Challenges in the reporting year and how we deal with it The supply chain is not only our largest source of emissions, but also one of the most complex ones. Accordingly, we faced chal - lenges in managing supply chain emissions in the reporting year: • Volatile CO2 reporting from key suppliers due to more precise emission reporting’s as well as regular GHG recalculations of our suppliers. • Changes in procurement type and spend depending on the business needs. • AI as an emissions driver. In order to take the volatile changes in the reported supply chain emissions into account also historically, we carry out regu - lar recalculations. The last recalculation took place in 2023. Another recalculation is planned for 2025, where we will consider the newest CO2 data available from our suppliers all the way back to our base year 2018.

This will allow us to better compare current emissions with our base year emissions and thus, enable us to follow our reduction path more precisely. We will also switch from a spend-based to an activity-based methodology for cer - tain products. This will provide us with a more reliable database and enable us to implement more targeted measures to further reduce our product emissions. The following are our most significant supply chain-related CO2 reduction actions and programmes: • Carbon Disclosure Programme (CDP) Transparency is the basis for implementing effective meas - ures. We require our strategically important suppliers to report their carbon footprint via the Carbon Disclosure Pro - gramme. In 2024, 146 suppliers (2023: 124) disclosed their J footprint . The reporting companies account for a spend share of 50%. Ywww.cdp.net • Supplier Engagement Programme (SEP) Based on our key suppliers’ CDP reports, we assigned them to one of five climate maturity levels. We presented our suppli - ers with the corresponding scorecard with information on specific areas for improvement, along with two invitations to CO2 reduction webinars (Basic & Advanced). • CO2 as a KPI for additional orders In emission-intensive product groups (e.g. network construc - tion), we introduced a concrete J ESG bonus model based on the SEP in the reporting year. Companies that perform par - ticularly well with their decarbonisation efforts can enhance their share of wallet. • Joint carbon reduction programmes (CRP) Suppliers with advanced climate maturity are invited to joint carbon reduction programmes with Swisscom. One example is our collaboration with Arcadyan on our new Internet-Box 5 Pro. It consists of 65% recycled plastic housing, plastic free packaging and has a programmable power-saving function for automatic switch-off/switch-on. HSee also ‘Reducing CO2 emissions of our own products’ section • Embedding ESG into the digitalised procurement process ESG criteria are anchored in our digital purchasing process (risk analysis, sourcing, supplier onboarding, contracting, sup - plier assessment and supplier development).

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryReducing CO2 emissions in relation to employee mobility Our employees’ mobility is another significant source of indirect emissions. We differentiate between commuter transport and business trips. • Commuter transport We strive to minimise commuting, by offering our employees the opportunity to work from home and a high degree of flexibility in where they work. We actively encourage the use of public transportation and are reducing our company parking spaces to reduce the incentive to use cars. • Business trips Due to the significant rise in online meetings, we are avoiding business trips wherever possible. We also have a strict authori - sation policy for flights. Over the coming years, we plan to implement further measures that will further reduce emissions caused by business travel. • Swiss Climate Challenge We ran a mobility challenge among the employees of Swisscom and the Swiss Post using the Swiss Climate Challenge app. It allowed a total of 2,300 users to track and compare the CO2 footprint of their mobility on an individual, department and company level and win attractive prizes like e.g. e-bikes or day passes for public transport. Reducing CO2 emissions in relation to our own products In addition to the sale of third-party products such as mobile phones, where our influence on design and energy efficiency is limited, we also offer our own products, including TV-Boxes, WLAN-Boxes and Internet-Boxes (routers) where we have direct influence on product design and circularity measures. Through the targeted application of J circular economy practices , we reduce material consumption during manufacture and elec - trical energy consumption during use of these products, thereby reducing their impact on the climate.In the reporting year, we conducted individual product-specific carbon footprint calculations for all our own products, including older product generations still on the market. The environmen - tal footprint is strongly related to the weight of the devices and is mainly influenced by the circuit board and the electronics. Product design therefore has a significant impact on the footprint. In line with our commitment to transparency, the results of these product carbon footprints are available on our website. Ywww.swisscom.ch/product-sustainability HSee also ‘Circular economy’ • TV-Boxes In the previous year (2023) we launched the new TV-Box 5, which requires 35% less electricity than its predecessors. Additionally, the product is composed of 65% recycled plastic and utilises no plastic in its packaging. The 53% reduction in volume has also resulted in a reduction in material require - ments. The further reduction of our TV-Boxes’ energy con - sumption means that we are able to reduce the energy con - sumption of all the TV-Boxes in use for blue TV. This impacts the devices’ carbon footprint in the use phase. • Routers In 2024, we launched the new Internet-Box 5 Pro.

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryClimate contribution Reducing our emissions has been and remains our top priority for climate mitigation. But despite our ambitious reduction tar - get of J net-zero by 2035, we want to take responsibility for at least a part of our unabated emissions now rather than later. By investing in climate projects outside of our value chain since 2020, we are positively contributing to global climate targets beyond our own reductions. Accordingly, we view our climate contribution activities as a complementary but essential lever for reaching the climate targets set by the Paris Agreement. In the last years, we monitored the system of climate protec - tion measures and the associated voluntary carbon market very closely. As a response to the current developments in the past two years, we have revised our climate contribution strategy: In order to maximise our positive impact on the climate, we have moved away from climate neutrality claims and focus on climate contribution through beyond value chain mitigation activities. This allows us to put a stronger accent on the generated impacts by financing a wider range of activities in the space of climate protection and accelerate the global net-zero transforma - tion by going above and beyond our science-based targets. In order to take responsibility, we are investing in carefully selected climate protection projects as an additional climate contribution beyond our science-based targets. Although we have chosen not to use certificates to offset our emissions anymore, we still invest in high-quality, high-integrity climate protection projects in accordance with the Gold Standard, the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Plan Vivo Standard. We have selected the portfolio of the projects we support based on the recommendations of the J SBTi and the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting.To ensure quality and integrity of these projects we have defined clear criteria for the projects, including: • Reliable and permanent CO2 avoidance or removal methodology. • Ambitiousness with clear monitoring and a contribution to further SDGs. • Geographically and methodologically diversified portfolio. • Relevance to Swisscom’s business through the use of technology. Our climate contribution on product level Our aim stays the same: we want to take responsibility for our emissions and, at the same time, ensure full transparency for our customers. Since this is not possible without ambiguity due to the contested use of the term ‘climate neutrality’ and a lack of regulation around double counting, we have decided to distance ourselves from this term. Our conviction that we should continue to additionally invest in climate protection projects and thus create a positive contribution to the global achievement of the climate targets remains thereby unchanged. The change of the term doesn’t change our level of support ambition for the climate.

Thus, we removed our target of becoming a climate-neutral company by 2025 and will adjust our contribution strategy in line with the latest guidance to Beyond Value Chain Mitigation of the SBTi. The adjustment of our contribution strategy is currently in development and will be announced in 2025. Ywww.swisscom.ch/climate-contribution Impacts beyond climate protection When compiling the portfolio, we aim for geographical and meth - odological diversification. We focus on low- and middle-income countries and emerging markets when supporting climate protec - tion projects. These regions are disproportionately affected by the impact of climate change despite only minimally contributing to its causes. High-quality climate protection projects also have a positive impact on the local communities and ecosystems, which supports the development of the regions. The projects thus contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Develop - ment Goals (UN SDGs) and we can achieve a greater positive impact with the same financial investment in the global south as opposed to in Switzerland. Nevertheless, we also aim to have a positive impact on climate and nature in Switzerland. That is why Swisscom, in collaboration with the Hochstamm Suisse association and Foundation mycli - mate, has launched a support programme to help farms plant and maintain standard trees. These trees not only capture CO2 from the atmosphere but are also valuable assets for the protection and retention of local biodiversity.

Since 2014, we have been recording the savings in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of our ICT services (avoided emis - sions, previously known as J Scope 4). Since 2018, we have been calculating these savings based on the ICT sector-specific guid - ance of the GHG Protocol. In future, we intend to adapt our calcula - tion methods to the recommendations of the European Green Digital Coalition (EGDC) that were published in the year under review. This initiative was launched in 2021 by European ICT and telecommunications companies to promote the development and spread of green technology. The methodology for calculat - ing these avoided emissions was also published on our website in the reporting year. Ywww.swisscom.ch/avoided-emissions-methodology Ywww.greendigitalcoalition.euAvoided emissions According to various studies1, the J ICT industry can make its greatest contribution to environmental and climate protection by enabling its customers to reduce their emissions through sus - tainable digital services. In the reporting year, for example, digitalswitzerland published the study ‘Smart and Green – Digi - tal Pathways to net-zero’ in cooperation with Accenture. It states that up to 20% of the reduction of greenhouse gases in Switzer - land needed by 2030 can be achieved through the use of digi - tal technologies in mobility, buildings, agriculture, industry and energy systems. Ywww.digitalswitzerland.com/de/smart-and-greenClimate protection solutions for our customers For corporate customers, which also includes cities and munic - ipalities, we offer the following product groups for reducing CO2 emissions. • Work Smart: solutions for video conferencing and working from home Thanks to our services, customers can eliminate some of their travel by communicating remotely by video and audio and remotely exchanging data. Savings in this area have fallen again, following an increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. • IoT solutions The Internet of Things (IoT) enables data-based control of devices, buildings and vehicles in real time, making systems more efficient and better at conserving resources. We hold competitions such as the IoT Climate Award and the StartUp Challenge to find and promote IoT companies with cli - mate-friendly services. Ywww.swisscom.ch/iot • Virtualisation and centralisation of data centres Our J cloud and housing services enable our customers to give up their own data centres and servers and outsource them to highly efficient data centres, largely operated with virtualised servers. • Extending the service life of electronic devices We refurbish used but still functional mobile phones, laptops, tablets, J routers and TV-Boxes so that they can be used again.

Over the last few years, the percentage of paperless invoices has increased to over 72%. This rate of digitalisation means that more than 2.1 million customers receive their monthly bills exclusively in digital form. • Data-driven sustainability At the start of 2024, we published a Software Radar with an overview of around 240 tools in the areas of carbon manage - ment, ESG management, supply chain management and risk management. Over the past two years, we have used this knowledge to support around 20 companies in selecting intel - ligent software solutions for the achievement of J net-zero emissions and their ESG reporting. These enable the automated collection of emissions from a variety of data sources, facili - tate the processing of measurement results for data-based decisions and the tracking of the reduction measures taken over several decades. We were allowed to implement Sweep, one of the world’s leading solutions in carbon and ESG man - agement, at a handful of companies. As a result of increasing regulation concerning non-financial reporting and climate protection in Switzerland and Europe, the need for companies to professionalise their CO2 and J ESG management is growing even more. Ywww.swisscom.ch/data-driven-sustainability Around 2,500 employees and customers of the companies Swiss Post and Swisscom participated in the Swiss Climate Challenge, which is a joint initiative, in the reporting year. By changing their mobility habits, they have saved a total of around 76 tonnes of CO2.

We utilise these companies’ solutions ourselves wherever possible and promote them to our customers. We also launched the DeepTech Nation Foundation, with the aim of expanding investments in Swiss-based start-ups together with its partners. With the climate protection solutions mentioned above, we and our customers avoided a total of 1,213,001 tonnes of CO2eq emissions in the reporting year. This quantity increased compared with the previous year by 54,660 tonnes. The main reason for this increase is the growth in avoided emissions from IoT services and a new streaming service which allows to hold international events remotely. 1 The SMARTer2030 study by GeSI concludes that 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide can be reduced through digital services. That is around six times more emissions than the ICT industry produces. A 2017 study by the University of Zurich and EMPA estimates that the intelligent use of ICT services in Switzerland could save around 3.5 times more emissions than the ICT sector produces by 2025. 37 Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024"

The longer a resource is used, the more environmentally friendly it is. We intend to reduce or stabilise their consumption in our operations. Our aim is to move gradually towards a circular economy spanning our entire value chain. The selection of materials and the manner in which they are used play a central role in procurement, oper - ation and use by our customers. As a network operator and supplier of mer - chandise such as mobile phones and self- developed devices such as the TV-Box and Internet-Box, we can play a relevant role in the circular economy on the Swiss market.Through recycling programmes for electronic terminal equipment, we are contributing to the implementation of our Sustainability Strategy 2025. We are also continuously reducing our own consumption of resources – particularly energy, building land and water – in the management of our telecommunications networks. We are also continuously developing our operational environmental com - patibility and our sustainable use of resources in accordance with J ISO 14001 . Measures and programmes As a retailer, we have a direct impact on the circular economy, particularly by extending the life of mobile phones. Due to our efforts, such as our take-back, repair and second-hand offers, we expand the lifetime of these products. Therefore, we reduce the demand for new devices, which helps conserve resources and protect the environment. Ywww.swisscom.ch/rethink Swisscom Mobile Aid and Mobile Aid Business We collect used mobile phones from both private individuals and companies. In the Mobile Aid programme, the data on the functioning devices is erased and the devices are then sold on the second-hand market. Faulty devices are recycled.

However, this trend is strongly declining. The manufacturer’s warranty remains valid thanks to the use of certified specialists and origi - nal parts. Used mobile phones Our take-back programme and resale of mobile phones reduce the demand for new devices, thus conserving resources and protecting the environment. Ywww.swisscom.ch/rethink Second-hand smartphones We are selling an increasing amount of ‘refreshed’ smartphone models, thereby extending the service life of existing devices. Ywww.swisscom.ch/refreshed Own products We have greater potential for influence and also face greater chal - lenges in the circular design of our own products, such as Inter - net-Boxes and TV-Boxes. With each product generation, our aim is to work hand-in-hand with our suppliers to improve the prod - ucts in terms of material consumption, energy consumption and durability, thereby reducing their environmental impact. The Internet-Box 5 Pro was launched in 2024. By making ecological improvements to the design of each new generation of our own products, we are reducing their environmental impact. For example, the electricity consumption of our custom - ers’ terminal equipment now amounts to 254 (2023: 262) GWh. The greatest improvements over the years have been achieved with our TV-Boxes. Tenders for suppliers J Circular economy approaches are asked about and assessed in the relevant tenders as standard. Suppliers are proactively invited to contribute their suggestions, measures and innovations. HSee also ‘Scope 3’Challenges in the circular economy A huge challenge for strengthening the circular economy is active participation by our customers. The return of devices that are no longer used and the reuse of the raw materials in them, known as urban mining, is an important component in our pro - grammes. We rely on direct customer information throughout the year, as well as raising awareness among the public and get - ting them to do their bit. Our focus is on encouraging customers to return their devices that are no longer used and bring them back into the cycle. This includes providing basic information about the raw materials used to produce mobile phones and how clos - ing the loop can help conserve resources and protect the envi - ronment.

Hsee ‘Circular economy key figures’ Targeted reverse logistics are important for the refurbishment of our own products. We offer the ‘take-me-back’ return system for TV-Boxes and Internet-Boxes. This means that equipment is collected by the postal service from the customer’s own mailbox and brought back to us. By that, we ensure that as many devices as possible are returned to us to be refurbished and used as replacement devices. Ywww.swisscom.ch/takemebackAnother challenge is packaging, for which we have further devel - oped our concept in order to reduce waste. The improvements made to the TV-Box 5 packaging box in the previous year are also being used for the new Internet-Boxes. Here too, we were able to completely dispense with plastic – both inside the box and for shipping. This meant that over 976,000 plastic bags could be avoided for our own products delivered in the reporting year. Packaging material has also been reduced in logistics. As many packages as possible – we sent over 899,000 to our customers in 2024 alone – are sent without outer packaging and without filler material.

We favour the use of substances with no or little impact on the environment and ensure that they are integrated into an economic cycle. Paper We are reducing paper consumption thanks to the complete digitalisation of work processes in the company and on the part of our customers. Since our offices are not yet completely paperless, we use recycled paper with the Blue Angel environ - mental label. Cables, optical fibres and telephone masts We are expanding the fibre-optic network to homes and busi - nesses throughout Switzerland. At the same time, we are disman - tling some of the infrastructure that is no longer needed to operate the copper access network (see table). Telephone masts on overhead lines are regularly checked, repaired or replaced. It is ensured that dismantled masts are used for other purposes or disposed of properly.Batteries and emergency power systems We regularly review the prescribed safety measures in the battery rooms to prevent any danger to the environment through the use of batteries. At the end of their service life, we recycle or dis - pose of the batteries in an environmentally friendly manner. The emergency power systems are only used during power out - ages and for a few hours a year during annual test runs. Dismantling of network infrastructure Management approach Where new high-performance networks are built, old networks are dismantled. For the dismantling and recycling, we follow the R3 approach: reusing, reselling and recycling. Our aim is to use the hardware ourselves for as long as possible. Only what can no longer be used internally is sold. When dismantling networks, we investigate the options availa - ble for selling valuable, fully functional components to other network operators as spare parts. What can neither be reused nor sold is recycled. Reusable materials such as copper, gold, silver, palladium, iron and aluminium are recovered. We attach great importance to short transport routes here. Overall, we are also reducing CO2 emissions, water, land and energy consump - tion in this way. We have developed a comprehensive waste disposal concept over many years. Supposed ‘junk’ is worth its weight in gold when treated correctly. For example, the dismantling of switch - boards that are no longer in use generates tonnes of copper cable. Reusable materials can be recovered by means of efficient recycling. We have found a competent partner to help with disposal in Thommen AG. By having a central recycling partner, we can ensure simpler handling and can also guarantee important aspects such as security, transparency and reporting, while keep - ing most of the added value in Switzerland.

Water We are aware of the importance of water as a resource, its increasing scarcity and the risks caused by climate change, such as floods and droughts. In our operations we need water for the sanitary facilities in our office buildings and for cooling some data centres. Flow limiters are used in the water pipes to reduce water consumption in our offices. Where possible, we use rainwa - ter. During renovation work, advanced valves with a reduced flow rate are integrated, which lower the consumption of water by up to 60%. We always use dry or hybrid cooling to cool our data centres. For the latter cooling method, we prefer to use rain, river or lake water, such as in our most innovative data centre in Bern Wankdorf. The cold rooms or refrigeration appliances are supplied with cooled water as refrigerant, which circulates in a closed circuit and therefore causes no further consumption. In all our operations, we adhere to our water policy. Ywww.swisscom.ch/water-policy Waste We are committed to avoid waste and select products based on their useful life.

With the image-recognition technology from Ecorobotix, the use of pesticides in agriculture can be reduced by around 95%. And thanks to xFarm’s software, farmers have a digital tool at their disposal with which they can assess and improve the effect that measures have on biodiversity, water consumption and climate protection. Ywww.ecorobotix.com Ywww.xfarm.agNature and biodiversity Alongside mitigating climate change, the preservation of biodiver - sity is considered one of the greatest challenges of our time. That’s why we began analysing the impacts and interdependen - cies of our operations on biodiversity in the reporting year and plan to continue this work in the coming year. Although we do not currently consider biodiversity as a material topic for us, we are, nevertheless, actively committed to the protection and promo - tion of local natural areas. With a series of targeted measures, we contribute to maintaining and strengthening biodiversity in Switzerland. Environmental Give2Grow work As part of our corporate volunteering programme Give2Grow, we offer our employees the opportunity to invest one working day a year in sustainable projects. Volunteering opportunities range from maintaining dry grasslands in the Jura region to removing invasive plants from urban areas. These projects, some of which are carried out in collaboration with the WWF, are designed to raise our employees’ awareness of biodiversity and to make an active contribution to preserving Switzerland’s natural environment. HSee also ‘Employer attractiveness’ Protection of the landscape and building land The base and transmitter stations form the backbone of our mobile networks and ensure that the whole of Switzerland has access to telecommunications, radio and TV service. When positioning the antennas, we consider not only radio technology aspects, but also their seamless integration into the landscape and town - scape and the efficient utilisation of building land. We make sure that as little surface area is sealed as possible. Con - struction of antennas must be approved by the authorities. In the reporting year there are 96 stations (1.57% of all Swisscom transmitter stations) in Ramsar and Emerald protection areas, water protection areas, migratory bird sanctuaries and moorlands. When decommissioned transmitter stations are demolished, we restore the vacated site to its natural state.Promoting insects and bees The bee@swisscom project is still going strong. Fifteen Swisscom beekeepers now look after around 65 bee colonies. We also further developed and co-financed the BEESmart app, a useful tool to check bee colonies and organise work in the apiary. We support wild bees by establishing nesting habitats in our operations centres. We do this by building wild bee hotels and participating in the construction of wild bee habitats. Through the Wildflower Meadow Initiative, we are creating a habitat for ground-nesting wild bee species.

Employees receive tips on how they can personally do their bit to improve biodiversity. Maintenance of the buildings’ surroundings We plan the maintenance of our buildings’ surroundings in such a way that the grasses can seed naturally so that flora and fauna can flourish. Although this process – which is great for biodiver - sity – takes time, it is very effective. It increases plant diversity and thus the food supply for insects. Invasive plants are identified and systematically removed. Standard tree project in Switzerland We support Hochstamm Suisse’s climate protection project to promote standard trees in Switzerland. In addition to its function as a carbon sink, this project makes a valuable contribution to the preservation of local biodiversity. The trees protect against soil erosion, reduce nutrient and pesticide seepage into ground and surface water, and contribute to biodiversity by providing valuable habitats for various animal species. 44 Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024"

They play a key role in new applications such as the Internet of Things, which is also gaining in importance in the industry. In future, an increasing number of processes whereby security is critical will be carried out digitally. The continuous expansion of networks is therefore a must in order to enable innova - tion among residential customers, start-ups, small companies and large corporations.We are constantly developing our digital infrastructure to keep pace with the increasing demand for broadband in the fixed and mobile networks. We invest around CHF 1.7 billion per year in our infrastructure in Switzerland, the majority of this in our networks. With our high-performance networks, we will be able to provide the entire population with bandwidths in the gigabit range and make a significant contribution to the attractiveness of the Swiss business community. We are expanding the fibre-optic network into homes and businesses and want to complete this in all Swiss municipalities by 2035.

    "text": "Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex GlossaryMobile telephony and society Protection Against Non-Ionising Radiation (ONIR). For sensitive locations (places of sensitive use) where people spend longer periods of time, the ONIR sets precautionary limits that are ten times stricter than those recommended by the WHO for pre - vention. The Federal Office for the Environment has published the third report on non-ionising radiation. According to the report, the median exposure of the population is below 1% of the emission limit value. The very restrictive regulation in Switzerland, there - fore, leads to extremely low exposure to non-ionising radiation. Strict limits are not being exhausted The enforcement regulations for these limits contain further precautionary reserves. These mean that even the already very restrictive limits can hardly be fully exhausted. At the majority of current sites, the approved performance limits have therefore already been reached. This has prompted a need for a large number of new antenna installations to cover the requirement. With the submitted motion 20.3237, Parliament is calling for practical simplifications and improvement of the framework condi - tions for mobile telecommunication. In this way, we were able to efficiently adapt the mobile network to the ever-increasing data volumes and Switzerland could fully utilise the possibilities of mobile communications. HSee ‘Actor in public debates’ Electromagnetic fields and local communities As a provider, we want to operate mobile communications responsibly for people and the environment. When operating the mobile communications systems, we ensure that we comply with the national environmental requirements and the cantonal and communal building standards at all times. For Swisscom, it is important to provide objective information and to engage in a constructive dialogue with local communities who may have further questions and concerns in this regard (e.g. dialogue with Swiss municipalities).Management approach Newer mobile generations are more energy efficient, reduce immissions and make better use of the limited radio spectrum available. A 5G mobile network plant consumes around 1.6 x less energy than a 4G plant in the LTE Advanced version to transmit the same data volume. Future 5G optimisations will increase this factor further. It is in everyone’s interest to replace older generations by updating to the latest one. Several thousand building applications for the expansion or modernisation of mobile tele - phony sites are pending across the industry. This can be partly explained by a sceptical attitude in parts of the population. However, building permit procedures are also not keep - ing pace with technology developments: due to a lack of permits, outdated, energy-ineffi - cient hardware often has to be installed.Developments in 2024 This situation worsened in the year under review. In decision 1C_506/2023 of 23 April 2024, the Federal Court stated that a regular building permit procedure is necessary for the first-time activation of the correction factor on adaptive antennas.

In decision 1C_414/2022 of 29 August 2024, the Federal Court decided that the change from a conventional antenna to an adaptive antenna leads to a change in the spatial distribution of radiation and a possible increase in the electric field strength, which means that the public and neighbours could have an interest in a prior review of this replacement through a regular building permit procedure. Ultimately, the Federal Court’s view is that any adjustments to mobile phone installations always require a regular building permit procedure. This has the consequence that Swisscom had to submit more than 1,000 retrospective building applications for the activation of the correction factor, even if the limits were complied with at all times. Although primarily a formal legal question, it increased the number of building permit applications for mobile communications systems pending with the relevant authorities across the sector from around 2,500 to more than 3,000. Accordingly, further 5G expansion in Switzerland is likely to be further delayed. This increases the pressure on the Federal Council to quickly and effectively implement motion 20.3237 submitted by Parlia - ment in September 2023 that calls for rapid expansion of the 5G network. Implementation of this motion would allow outdated regulations for calculating transmission power to be adapted to reflect developments and findings over the last 20 years and building permit procedures to be simplified.

WHO research results The World Health Organization (WHO) published various research reviews in 2024. The results are rather pleasing; the key findings of these meta-studies are: • There is no evidence for or against harmful effects of High Frequency-Electro Magnetic Fields (RF-EMF) below the limit values on pregnancy and birth outcomes. • There is no increased risk of brain tumours from RF-EMF. • RF-EMF does not cause non-specific symptoms. • There is no evidence for or against oxidative stress from RF-EMF. The main part – up to 90% – of the immissions comes from the user’s own terminal equipment; only a small part is caused by the mobile communications infrastructure.

Yfrag.michael@swisscom.com Regulatory initiatives and projects Regulatory plans of the Confederation In autumn 2022, the Swiss parliament passed the Act on the Protection of Minors in relation to Films and Video Games (JSFVG), and in the year under review, the associated ordinance was enacted into law by the Federal Council as of 1 January 2025. With a transition period of two years, the industry members (cinemas, media libraries, VoD providers and the film industry) are required to organise themselves in an overarching industry organisation and submit an implementation plan to the Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO). In the year under review, the first steps with stakeholders already took place on the initiative of the Jugendschutz im Film association. Industry Initiative of the Swiss Association of Telecommunications (asut) Following the introduction of the JSFVG and its ordinance (JSFVV), J asut ’s code of conduct governing youth media protection is being updated to incorporate the new legal provisions. As an industry organisation whose members include the largest VoD provider based in Switzerland, asut was part of the aforemen - tioned talks.

Ywww.swisscom.ch/ai-course (english n/a) Security in the school environment Many schools have developed an ICT policy in the past few years. However, security aspects are rarely included with sufficient depth. In the school environment, where a large quantity of sen - sitive data accumulates, consciously dealing with dangers from the internet is important. A three-part series raises awareness of risks at school level, in teachers’ daily lives and in the use of digital tools in teaching. Technical youth media protection We consider the promotion of media competency to be the most promising way to protect children and young people from the risks of digital media, including in the long term. In addition, tech - nical protective measures can protect young people from inappropriate content such as pornographic and violent content. Secure products When developing new products and services, we check whether the mechanisms for youth media protection are being used effectively. The parental control function or age verification can be used to make certain content inaccessible to young people. blue TV also has a blocking function that enables content and commercial restrictions on video-on-demand content (VoD con - tent). We also block value-added services with erotic content (0906 numbers and value-added services) for young people and give parents the option of setting surfing times for their children via the Internet-Box.

In a coalition of four telecom operators, Swisscom supports the Child Labour Remediation Hub project with an amount of CHF 100,000 per year. The project, carried out by Save the Children and the Centre for Child Rights and Business, is taking measures to combat child labour in arti - sanal cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It focuses on long-term solutions to get young people back into education and meaningful employment. The focus is on educational integration, housing scholarships and health and psychosocial support for affected children and their families.

In 2024, we therefore produced videos in sign language to show customers how to use WhatsApp as a channel to interact with Swisscom. We also launched an innovative project to translate the general terms and conditions of Swisscom’s contracts into clear and simple language. The aim is to remove any obstacles to understanding that may arise from the use of abstract legal language and to make it understanda - ble for everyone. Ywww.swisscom.ch/sign-language-video (english n/a) As part of our basic services, we offer the following services for people with disabilities: by dialling the phone number 1145, they will be connected directly and free of charge to a contact person of their choice. Together with the PROCOM foundation, we offer the deaf and hard of hearing a free online translation service into sign language for phone calls with hearing people. Ywww.swisscom.ch/accessibility New Alliance for Digital Inclusion Switzerland Together with 29 other companies and institutions, Swisscom founded the Digital Inclusion Switzerland Alliance in 2024. At a time when digital skills are becoming increasingly important, the alliance aims to narrow the digital divide that excludes many citizens from the benefits of digitalisation. The aim of this alli - ance is to break down digital barriers and create an inclusive digi - tal future for all (eliminating the digital divide, accessibility, professional integration). Ywww.adis.chManagement approach We attach great importance to our products and services being accessible for everyone and adhere to the Swiss Disability Discrimina - tion Act (DDA). In view of the large number of products, services and communication chan - nels, our strategy is first and foremost to make the most popular products and chan - nels accessible.The accessibility of our shops and call centres must meet strict legal requirements and is continuously improved. To this end, we work together with recognised organisations, such as the Vision Positive agency and the Swiss Association of the Deaf. The realisation of barrier-free access is based on three pillars: 1. Monitoring Since 2023, the employees in the various teams who are responsible for accessibility have been regularly reviewing pro - gress and difficulties. 2. Testing Every change to a product is checked for barrier-free access. In addition to internal testing, our partner Applause carries out extensive tests every month. Improved barrier-free access is the result of the iterative interplay of testing and problem solving. 3. Awareness and training Progress in achieving barrier-free access depends on all employees. Employees whose tasks and roles involve improving barrier-free access (e.g. graphic designers) are regularly informed about the topic through training sessions.

We maintain flat hierarchies and promote interdisciplinary, autonomous teams in which every - one thinks and acts with an entrepreneurial mindset. This way of working is characterised by collaboration on an equal footing. In order for this to succeed, it is important to keep an open dia - logue at work and provide an appealing workplace environment. Some areas have already been redesigned, while further offices will gradually be redesigned in the next few years to better reflect changing requirements (new ways of working). Corporate volunteering – Give2Grow and Move Volunteering is an important part of our culture. With Give2Grow, all employees can dedicate one day a year to a charitable or ecological project. As part of Move, employees offer their col - leagues sporting or creative activities. Innovative talent attraction In response to the shortage of skilled workers, we rely on inno - vative and award-winning approaches in talent attraction. Application methods are being systematically simplified: interested parties can apply via video or with their LinkedIn profile. Alter - natively, they can meet with a contact person for a non-binding chat over a cup of coffee. In order to reach and attract our target group, we rely on creative recruitment approaches, such as gam - ing and specific recruitment campaigns. So that they can get a picture of Swisscom and the various careers in ICT, we offer various event formats for managers, university students and school pupils, such as the Digital Days for Girls, TechTalks and taster days. To make these happen, we work with external partners such as ecole42 Lausanne and other higher education institutions and universities.Employer attractiveness Management approach In view of the increasing shortage of skilled workers, employer attractiveness is a priority for us, especially for IT roles.

Both can lead to stress. As an employer, we support employees to stay healthy and moti - vated in the long term. We attach particular importance to the prevention and early identifi - cation of psychosocial issues. Sovis, Swisscom’s personnel fund, contributes to the costs of preventive measures.We create a safe and trusting working environment and pro - mote resilience: • Competence centre for health and care expertise (awareness, courses, Care Gate as anonymous contact and advice centre). • Internal ‘Empower Yourself’ campaign, with monthly contri - butions on well-being, health topics and prevention. • Courses on ‘mental health first aid’. • Annual survey of stress levels, presenteeism, management issues and conflict in the team by means of a questionnaire. • Stress analysis in teams with alarming results. • Voluntary health checks for the early detection of health prob - lems for managers who do not report their working hours. • With the ‘Fit for Work & Life’ training programme for appren - tices, we have special sessions for promoting mental health, dealing with money, and awareness of bullying and sexual harassment. Safety in the workplace and safety certification We proactively look after the health and well-being of our employ - ees by practising a holistic prevention culture. By signing our latest Safety & Health Charter, our commitment has been adapted to the latest developments in the working world. Protecting the physical and mental integrity of customers, employees and partners in our buildings and plants and when carrying out work for Swisscom is of key importance.

The exchange and collaboration that takes place between the generations are valuable and enriching. We encourage these through diverse teams and programmes such as cross-generational mentoring. In addition, we piloted the Senior Professionals project in the year under review, which is intended to promote the health and moti - vation of employees aged over 50 through a preventive approach. Inclusion At least 1% of jobs at Swisscom are reserved for employees with physical or intellectual disabilities and for the social integra - tion of refugees. To achieve this, we work with organisations such as Compasso and Powercoders. In this way, we have employed 13 people with a refugee background as interns. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report has been published for the first time in 2024. In this report, we provide transparent and detailed information about our DE&I engagement with figures, ambitions and measures. Ywww.swisscom.ch/diversityDiversity, equity and inclusion Management approach We stand for a culture in which differences are valued and discrimination and exclusion have no place. We promote diversity in terms of gender, sexual orientation, age, origin, language and the inclusion of employees with a physi - cal or intellectual disability or with a refugee background. This diversity promotes innovation and makes us successful as a company, which is why we design our processes in recruitment, develop - ment, talent management and leadership culture in such a way that they counteract ste - reotypes and enable equal opportunities. Group-wide targets for the diversity categories are measured and reported on a regular basis. All the categories are gradually improving due to this active management. This is demon - strated by, among other things, the fact that we were again awarded the ‘Swiss LGBTI Label’ in the year under review. In addition, we are seeing more diversity among candidates, among new hires and in the talent pool.Nationality and language Four national languages and cultural diversity are Switzerland’s trademark – and great assets. Employees from around 100 coun - tries work together to make Swisscom a success, and our lin - guistic diversity is correspondingly high. English is therefore grow - ing in significance as a common language. We also promote this language diversity by offering our employees language courses and, for example, talent and training and development pro - grammes in different languages. Gender equality We are committed to equal rights for women and men. Here, we face the challenge of increasing the proportion of women in management positions. The percentage of qualified women in the IT sectors is still low and too few applications are submitted by women for technical job profiles.

    "text": "from around 100 coun - tries work together to make Swisscom a success, and our lin - guistic diversity is correspondingly high. English is therefore grow - ing in significance as a common language. We also promote this language diversity by offering our employees language courses and, for example, talent and training and development pro - grammes in different languages. Gender equality We are committed to equal rights for women and men. Here, we face the challenge of increasing the proportion of women in management positions. The percentage of qualified women in the IT sectors is still low and too few applications are submitted by women for technical job profiles. In order to spark interest in Swisscom and in technical professions among young female talent, we offer, for example, Digital Days for Girls. We also offer job-sharing and part-time positions, which ensures a good work-life balance. In recognition of our efforts in this area, we obtained recertification as a ‘family-friendly company’ for the third time in a row in the year under review, and are permitted to use the ‘Family Score’ label from Pro Familia Switzerland for another three years. Communities Swisscom is committed to supporting stakeholder communities that are affected by its activities. This includes networks of employees with concerns about diversity. Internal communi - ties, including WoMen’s Empowerment, Neurodiversity and Proud@Swisscom, together boast more than 1,800 participants. Joint networking events and talks bring committed employees together and thus make a significant contribution to an inclusive corporate culture. Equal pay We review the salary structure for differences between the genders’ wages each year using the federal government’s equal pay tool (Logib). The investigations to date have revealed small wage differences that are below the Confederation’s tolerance threshold of 5%.23.1% This is the current proportion of women at Swisscom. 1.22% Employees with health impairments that work at Swisscom. 102 This is how many countries our employees come from. 57 Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024"

It is made up of four members from differ - ent areas of Swisscom and is chaired by the Chief Communication Officer, who is also responsible for ethics. Diversity is considered in the composition of the Board. In the reporting year, two meet - ings were held on the use of generative artificial intelligence in customer service. One meeting considered a use case, which had already been reviewed and recommended for revision in 2023. The updated scenario was approved by the Board. The second meeting discussed a framework for data processing in the cus - tomer service environment. This framework was rejected for revi- sion. Furthermore, as part of the new AI governance, a question - naire that deals with the principle of fairness in the Data Ethics Board along the six ethical principles was developed for high-risk AI systems. Integration All employees are taught about lawful and value-oriented con - duct through a cascade of information and measures that are appropriate to their level. In the year under review, all employees received e-learning training on the topic of trust and ethics. In the second quarter, senior management were trained on the topic of trust and ethics through ‘Trust Workshops’ in connec - tion with the implementation of the ‘Innovators of Trust’ vision. In addition, a Swisscom Switzerland-wide online ethics training Management approach We pursue a corporate strategy that is com - mitted to ethical principles. Corporate ethics means considering the needs and consequences of our actions for all stake - holder groups and upholding fundamental social values such as freedom, justice, equality and security. Data and AI ethics are a central part of our commitment to digital responsibility.Ethical conduct is integrated into our Code of Conduct. As a mat - ter of principle, we trust our employees to act responsibly, taking into account the aspects of society, the environment and the economy (Code of Conduct, Section 4). In day-to-day busi - ness, however, conflicting needs exist and, as a result, conflicting objectives arise. Balancing these needs against each other is a challenge. To minimise the risk of making bad decisions, we have integrated corporate ethics into the Group strategy with meas - urable governance.

The training programme is mandatory for all employ - ees, including part-time and external staff. It is also used for new employees in the onboarding process. Measurement When measuring corporate ethics, the focus is on two key indi - cators: the degree of internal awareness and external perception. Internal awareness is measured by the proportion of internal employees who have completed ethics training, which was at 91% as of the end of 2024. The Group Executive Board has set a tar - get of 100%. Monthly reputation measurement using the RepTrak survey tool shows the extent to which Swisscom’s conduct is perceived externally as being ethical. We have 67.6 points for the governance aspect at the end of 2024 (previous year: 67.9 points). The Group Executive Board has set the target of achieving 70 points by 2025.

Consultations During the year under review, as in previous financial years, we submitted statements as part of consultations at federal level. For example, in these matters: • Management measures in the event of a power shortage Here, the industry used a proactively developed solution to ensure that specific industry rules apply to it in the event of power quotas. These are now being developed at regulation level. • Strengthening of mobile phone networks On 1 November 2023, the Federal Council opened the consul - tation on measures to strengthen mobile networks against power supply disruptions. The deadline for submissions ended on 16 February 2024. In general, this concerns the question of how long mobile phone networks must remain operational during power outages in order to enable emergency call In the year under review, we expressed our views on other topics under political debate, such as in the context of parliamentary committee hearings or to other political institutions, and, in some cases, also within a broader alliance of providers and industry: • Greenwashing with the introduction of a special offence in the Unfair Competition Act (UCA Art. 3 x) • Overview on the possible regulation of artificial intelligence on the occasion of the ‘Plateforme Tripartite’ events • Protection of critical infrastructure from geopolitical inter - ests (Mo 22.3414 and Po 20.3984), where it is a matter of prohibiting certain manufacturers and providers of network components in Switzerland, as has already been decided in other countries. The topic of J roaming repeatedly generates new proposals (Mo 23.3402 and Mo 23.4045). We support the topic in our polit - ical work. Work to implement the ‘Strengthening the public service’ motion (20.4328) is still expected.

The latter (Mo 24.3191) has already been rejected by the National Council. The Federal Council is also requesting that the proposal for privatisation/ split-up should be rejected. • The digital sovereignty issue is gaining weight in the political debate, not least because of a postulate (Po 22.4411), which calls for a corresponding strategy for Switzerland. Several pro - posals also call for the adoption of EU regulations or an adap - tation of Swiss legislation in regard to the regulation of large tech companies, such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). The Federal Council instructed the relevant offices to draft a legislative proposal for Switzerland based on the DSA, and to present this draft in the near future. • Beyond Parliament, the topic of mobile communication expansion is likely to remain part of the broader public politi - cal debate. Many building applications are still pending in the municipalities. Not least also due to a Federal Supreme Court decision in 2024, which leads to the fact, that the application of the correction factor for adaptive antennas must be subsequently authorised as part of an ordinary construc - tion procedure. This leads to additional work for both Swisscom and the authorities, especially the municipalities, which assess the planning applications. • The Federal Act on Electronic Identity Credentials and Other Electronic Credentials (e-ID Act) was passed in the Parliament in the reporting year. It sets the course for electronic identity (e-ID). We welcome a swift, clear regulation to guide our tech - nical innovations. 65 Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024"

The aim is to reduce risks not only in ethical, social and environmental terms, but also with regard to finance, logistics, quality and secu - rity of supply. It also assesses the entire purchasing volume in terms of human rights risks and impacts. We pay particular atten - tion to monitoring all purchasing transactions with elevated risks (around 30%) and procurements with our top 100 suppliers. In 2024, we have rolled out our new ESG Supplier Code of Conduct to 86/117 of our high-risk suppliers, covering 83% of our total spend. Our risk assessment is based on a global corporate responsibility standard and is integrated into our digital procurement process. With the qualification of each supplier for a corresponding prod - uct group, J ESG has been an integral part of the procurement process since 2022. We are also implementing more in-depth ESG assessments and corrective measures with existing suppliers via the EcoVadis sustainability rating platform. Our measures have enabled us to achieve a score of 90/100 on J EcoVadis in the area of sustainable procurement (see also the Swisscom portfo - lio performance table on our suppliers’ score). Ywww.swisscom.ch/governance Ywww.ecovadis.comManagement approach As a leading Swiss ICT company, we are com - mitted to fair procurement and supply chains. The most important risks in the ICT sector’s supply chains include not only environmental impacts but also human rights issues. Respect - ing and protecting these rights in accordance with the relevant ILO, OECD and SA 8000 stand - ards is a key element of our sustainability strategy and corporate responsibility. Our guide - lines on children and human rights are pub - lished on our website. Ywww.swisscom.ch/humanrightsRisks to workers and communities can arise throughout the supply and value chains of the products and services Swisscom provides. These risks can materialise in the area of employee health and safety, as well as human rights challenges such as child labour, forced labour and unsafe working conditions in the mining of metals and minerals essential for electronic components. Our efforts to ensure fair and sustainable supply chains are risk- based and prioritise the following topics: • Prohibition of child and forced labour • Protection of the rights to health, safety, collective bargaining and freedom of association • Setting reasonable limits on working hours • Ensuring fair remuneration These risks are often hidden in the lower levels of our value chain, in which we have little insight or influence on the processes thereof. Collaborating on collective solutions within the J ICT sector is therefore at the centre of our corporate due diligence. We also rely on a holistic risk management system, which we use to systematically check our supplier relationships for risks.

We set specific standards for child labour and conflict minerals and oblige our supply part - ners to report any suspected cases to us. In 2024, Swisscom updated its ESG Contract Annex. Currently, 83% of our spend falls under those requirements and we work to further expand this coverage. • Risk and impact analysis Transparency is the key to fair supply chains. We use UNICEF’s ‘Children’s Rights in the Workplace Index’ via our Supply Chain Risk Tool to monitor specific country risks in relation to child labour. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our proprietary products on the gradual disclosure and pres - entation of the relevant supply chains in this tool in order to better understand the origin of the materials and metals used.

Raw materials, conflict minerals and metals We do not import or process any conflict minerals or metals. In general, tracking the origin of raw materials, minerals and metals in the global ICT supply chains represents a major challenge due to the enormous complexity involved. We recognise our respon - sibility in this regard and take the following measures: We require our suppliers to make the origin of their raw materials traceable, report suspected cases of human rights violations to us and take effective measures to end and remedy these inci - dents. This obligation is set out in the Swisscom ESG contract annex and is also communicated throughout the industry via the Sustainability Guidelines of the JAC Initiative. Compliance with these requirements is monitored within the scope of J audits . As part of the SCRM 360° risk management system, suspected cases and fair procurement practices regarding the extraction of raw materials from strategically important suppliers are also continuously reviewed and monitored.Whistleblowing Our whistleblowing channel is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP No. 29). The channel guarantees anonymous, transparent and legally compliant whistle - blowing in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and non-retaliation. Complaints are categorised according to the extent, resolvability and severity of the impact on those affected. Remediation and development measures are then taken in exchange and dialogue with relevant suppliers and the whistleblowers.

We support our suppliers in the implementation of corrective measures based on the results of these audits. The following risk categories are checked as part of on-site industry-level audits. • Health and safety: emergency exits, emergency lights and the handling and storage of hazardous substances • Rights of employees and dealing with them: freedom of asso - ciation, discrimination, disciplinary measures • Working hours: keeping to working hours, overtime and rest days • Salaries and benefits: social security, minimum wages and deductions • Environmental protection: J greenhouse gas emissions (measurement, reduction targets, involvement of suppliers/ sub-suppliers), implementation of environmental issues along the supply chain • Child labour and young workers: checking the minimum age and hazardous work, night shifts • Forced labour: lack of employment contracts • Business ethics: conflict minerals, data security, anti-competi - tive practices, corruption and bribery The audited suppliers included mostly Asian producers from the areas of IT hardware, software and services as well as net - work infrastructure. In the year under review, 139 audits were carried out in the JAC network; in the previous year, 149 were carried out.

The reporting boundaries of the greenhouse gas inventory for Scope 1, 2 and 3 is Swisscom in Switzerland. To this end, we re-revised the report - ing boundaries in 2023, made adjustments and recalculated the emissions retroactively up to and including the base year 2018. The values concerned have been restated accordingly. The activities of the companies in Switzerland that are fully consoli - dated (stake > 50%) are included in the inventory. The emis - sions of CO2-relevant foreign subsidiaries such as Fastweb and investment in start-ups by Swisscom Ventures are recorded under Scope 3, Category 15 (investments). With the exception of Fastweb, all Group companies domiciled abroad as well as investments in associates are not included in the inventory, as their environmental impact is minor compared to that of Swisscom Ltd. Similarly, the emissions from downstream leased assets (Scope 3, Category 13) and the transportation of prod - ucts to our customers (Scope 3, Category 10) are not included in the scope of the report. Furthermore, Scope 3, Categories 10 (processing of sold products) and 14 (franchises) are not relevant, as we do not manufacture any products or have any franchises.

As part of target setting according to the SBTi at Group level (including Fastweb), 2018 has been taken as the base year (652,929 tonnes of CO2eq). We have energy data for the base years that have been published and verified. Changes to the calculation of emissions In the past reporting year 2023, adjustments to the calculation of emissions that resulted in a change in greenhouse gas emis - sions by more than 5% led to a recalculation of the emissions up to and including the 2018 reporting year. The main adjustments can be found in last year’s report. Ywww.swisscom.ch/sir2023 Biomass, removal and CO2 sinks As in previous years, we did not make use of any forms of CO2 removal or CO2 sinks within the operational scope of the company in the year under review. Some locations are heated with wood pellets (biomass). The heating systems are the automatic pellet firing type with an output of less than 50 kW (system category 11). The amount of biomass consumed is recorded, and the CO2 equivalents reported according to the GHG Protocol. The CO2 (‘0/0’ method) not taken into account by the GHG Protocol due to the closed cycle is disclosed separately here and is 132 tCO2 in the reporting year. In addition, we do not have any relevant emissions from activities associated with land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), as Swisscom’s activities only have a marginal impact on agricultural areas due to transmitter sta - tions in rural areas. Greenhouse gas inventory according to ISO 14064 A greenhouse gas inventory according to ISO 14064 includes the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as the emissions of synthetic gases such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and, since 2013, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). This list is consistent with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the GHG Protocol standard. We report our emissions within our reporting boundaries in the aggregated form of CO2 equiva - lents for CO2, CH4 and N2O, with the individual greenhouse gases shown as footnotes. HFC refrigerants used within the consolida - tion boundaries are listed separately. The emission sources and their global-warming potentials (GWP) are described below.

These are Categories 9 (downstream trans - portation), 10 (processing of sold products), 13 (downstream leased assets) and 14 (franchises), which are not relevant for us . Emission factors Emission factors for Scope 1 emissions: Since 2015, we have used the emission factors of the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database (version 3.10 applied) for Scope 1 emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels. For Scope 1 emissions, we use the corresponding global-warming potential with a horizon of 100 years (GWP100) and report the emissions in tonnes of CO2eq. (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2021). Emission factors for Scope 2 emissions: The emission factor for the consumer electricity mix was calcu - lated by external experts (treeze ltd) based on existing studies (Frischknecht et al (2020); KBOB, ecobau and IPB (2023) and Krebs L. and Frischknecht R. (2020)) in 2024. It represents the electricity supplied to Swiss end customers. It corresponds to the standard Swiss electricity mix, which is to be used in life cycle assess - ments in accordance with the accounting rules of KBOB if the specific electricity product is not known or an average J elec - tricity mix is to be used. It is determined based on domestic pro- duction and commercial trade (see also Frischknecht et al. 2020; Krebs & Frischknecht 2020). Firstly, the amount of elec - tricity produced domestically and available to domestic con - sumers is determined for each hour of the year by subtracting the commercial export volume from the production volume. The domestic production mix for the same hour is then allocated to this electricity volume. The commercial imports from the neighbouring countries Germany, France, Italy and Austria are modelled with the respective national hourly production mixes of these countries and added to the domestic production remain - ing in Switzerland. The data on electricity production, pumped storage pump consumption and electricity trading are taken from the ENTSO-E transparency platform. The data used on electricity consumption in Switzerland in 2022 were published by Swissgrid. Combustion • CO2: Combustion of fossil fuels (heating and mobility) or from the processes to produce electricity (biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion – i.e. from wood heating – continues to remain at a marginal level) • CH4: Combustion of fossil fuels (heating and mobility) • N2O: Combustion of fossil fuels (heating and mobility) Cooling • HFC: Loss of refrigerants from cooling systems • PFC: Loss of refrigerants.

IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. 2021 – Chapter 7. Upstream and downstream levels for Scope 3 analysis The analysis of Scope 3 emissions in Categories 6 and 7 (busi - ness travel and employee commuting) along with Category 8 (rented spaces without operational control) considers not only direct operations but also the upstream and downstream activi - ties in connection with the manufacture of vehicles (trains and cars) and the construction of infrastructure (road and rail). The consideration of upstream and downstream levels is optional under the GHG Protocol standard. Upstream and down - stream activities for the other categories are not recorded due to a lack of data. We source our district heating from different heat networks. Since 2018, the emission factor for district heating has been cal - culated by scope (Scope 2 and Scope 3) and the emission factor according to the Intep study has been used. Emission factors for Scope 3 emissions: For Scope 3 emissions during the year under review, we use the emission factors from the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database version 3.9 for mobility (as shown in mobitool v3.0). Specific emission factors are incorporated as follows: • Determining emissions in the supply chain (Categories 1, 2, 4 and 8) The relevant emission factors are calculated for the individual scopes based on data from ecoinvent version 3.8 by EBP (methodology for determining greenhouse gas emissions in the J ICT sector supply chain). For downstream transport and distribution to customers, the relevant emission factors and emissions are determined by the respective logistics partner. • Provision of electricity (Category 3,"

    "text": "93 Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex Glossary Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024 Glossary WLAN (wireless local area network): A WLAN is a wireless local area network. WLANs connect several computers wirelessly and link them to a central information system, printer or scanner. Sustainability terms Avoided emissions (formerly Scope 4): Emission reductions resulting from the enabling effects of the use of ICT services by customers. Beyond Value Chain Mitigation: BVCM refers to mitigation activities that reduce the impact of climate change outside (beyond) of a company’s value chain. This includes, for example, financing climate and nature projects that avoid GHG emis - sions from entering the atmosphere or actively remove GHGs from the atmosphere. Circular economy: The circular economy is characterised by the fact that raw materials are used efficiently and for as long as possible. If we succeed in closing material and product cycles, raw materials can be used again and again. CR Champions: The CR Champions are employees in the various Swisscom business divisions who have been selected to implement measures and report on the progress of their implementation. CSR: Corporate social responsibility refers to corporate responsi - bility for people, society and the environment. EcoVadis: The EcoVadis online platform supports the enforcement of environmental and social standards in global supply chains through uniform sustainability rankings of suppliers. As part of its risk management system, Swisscom bases its purchasing activities on the declarations made with EcoVadis by its suppliers.Technical terms 4G/LTE (Long-Term Evolution): 4G/LTE is the fourth generation of mobile technology. At present, LTE enables mobile broadband data speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s. 5G: The latest generation in mobile network technology. 5G provides more capacity, faster response times and higher band - widths. Bandwidth: Bandwidth refers to the transmission capacity of a medium, also known as the data transmission rate. The higher the andwidth, the more information units (bits) can be transmit - ted per unit of time (second). It is defined in bit/s, kbit/s, Mbit/s. Cloud: Cloud computing makes it possible for IT infrastructures such as computing capacity, data storage, ready-to-use software and platforms to be accessed dynamically via the internet as needed. The data centres, along with the resources and databases, are distributed via the cloud. The term ‘cloud’ refers to such hardware which is not precisely locatable. Free cooling: If a building is cooled freely, i.e. without refrigerants, this is known as free cooling. Outside air, groundwater, lake water, river water or the ground can be used as a cooling source. FTTH (Fibre to the Home): FTTH refers to the end-to-end connection of homes and businesses using fibre-optic cables instead of traditional copper cables. ICT (information and communication technology): The terms ‘information technology’ and ‘communication technology’ were first combined in the 1980s to denote the convergence of infor - mation technology (information and data processing and the related hardware) and communication technology (technically aided communications). IoT (Internet of Things): The networking of things, devices and machines to enable recording"

IoT (Internet of Things): The networking of things, devices and machines to enable recording of status and environmental data. These data provide the basis for optimising processes, such as early identification of failing machine components. This facilitates new business models and opens up new opportunities for cus - tomer interaction. Optical fibre: Optical fibre cables (or fibre-optic cables) are a transport medium for optical data transmission – in contrast to copper cables, which transmit data through electrical signals. Roaming: Roaming is when a mobile user makes calls, uses other mobile services or participates in data traffic outside their home network, i.e. usually abroad. This requires that the mobile device in question is compatible with the roaming network. In Europe, all GSM networks use the same frequency bands. Other countries such as the USA and countries in South America use a different frequency range. Routers: Routers are devices for connecting or separating sev - eral computer networks. The router analyses incoming data packets according to their destination address and either blocks them or forwards them accordingly (routing). Routers come in different types, ranging from large machines in a network to the small devices used by residential customers. Ultra-fast broadband: Ultra-fast broadband denotes broadband speeds of more than 50 Mbit/s – on both the fixed-line and mobile networks.EEC: Exemplary Energy and Climate (EEC) is one of twelve meas - ures in the Confederation’s Energy Strategy 2050. It is aimed at companies with close ties to the government, companies with close ties to the cantons, and larger organisations from all over Switzerland that want to be innovators and role models in the field of energy. By signing a declaration of intent, they are com - mitting to making an ambitious contribution to increasing energy efficiency and expanding renewable energies in Switzerland. Electromagnetic fields: Electromagnetic fields occur naturally or are generated technically. They are non-ionising. This means that they do not have enough energy to change the building blocks of matter. Electromagnetic fields are divided into low fre- quency and high frequency according to the number of oscilla - tions per second. EnAW: Energy Agency for Industry.

Swisscom joined the Energy Agency in 2003 and signed a new agreement on objectives to increase its energy efficiency. ESG: ESG refers to the consideration of environmental, social and governance issues. Electricity mix: The composition of electricity by type of energy production (e.g. hydroelectric or wind power). Footprint: The term ‘footprint’, also called carbon footprint or CO2 footprint, is the result of an emissions calculation. It indicates the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by an activity or a product. In the case of products, for example, the carbon foot - print includes the total emissions caused by production, use and disposal."

    "text": "94 Introduction Sustainability strategy Environment People Conduct Report Index and annex Glossary Swisscom – Sustainability Impact Report 2024 GeSI: Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The GeSI is an initiative of companies from the ICT sector, whose aim is to pro- mote sustainability. Swisscom works within the framework of the initiative to promote fair and sustainable supply chains in particular. GRI: The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an organisation that develops guidelines for the preparation of corporate sus - tainability reports in a participatory process. GRI standards: The GRI standards represent global best practices for public corporate reporting on various economic, environ - mental and social impacts. Sustainability reporting based on these standards provides information about the positive or negative contributions of an organisation to sustainable development. ISO 14001: An international environmental management standard that sets globally recognised requirements for environ - mental management systems. ISO 14064: This standard is part of the ISO 14000 series of inter - national standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for environmental management. The aim of ISO 14064 is to enable uniform climate reporting and to help companies and organisations to reduce emissions. JAC: Joint Alliance for CSR. The elimination of any vulnerabilities identified is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the environmental and social standards we expect. Within the framework of JAC, an international alliance of telecoms companies plans and conducts CSR audits of suppliers. Swisscom has been a member of JAC since 2012. SA8000: An international standard with the aim of improving working conditions for employees. SASB : The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, like the GRI, sets industry-specific guidelines for public corporate report - ing on various economic, environmental and social impacts.Greenhouse gas (GHG): Greenhouse gases, also referred to as ‘climate gases’, such as CO2, methane, sulphur hexafluoride, N2O and F-gases, refer to those gases that cause the ‘greenhouse effect’ by reflecting the sun’s rays within the atmosphere. IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): The Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, was founded in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to summarise the current state of scientific research on climate change for political deci - sion-makers. The IPCC Secretariat is based in Geneva. Location-based or market-based: The location-based method models emissions from the electricity consumption based on the Swiss power grid’s average emission intensity (before offsetting trough RECs). The market-based method models the emissions from the electricity purchased e.g. through energy attribute certificates like renewable energy certificates RECs (after offsetting trough RECs). Net zero: The net-zero state describes an equilibrium in which no more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere than the amount that can be removed. This means that green - house gas emissions in the atmosphere remain constant and do not increase any further. This state is achieved through max - imum CO2 reductions and additional neutralisation (CO2 removal) of unavoidable residual emissions. ONIR: The Swiss Ordinance on Protection against Non-Ionising Radiation (ONIR) defines the maximum permissible"

This state is achieved through max - imum CO2 reductions and additional neutralisation (CO2 removal) of unavoidable residual emissions. ONIR: The Swiss Ordinance on Protection against Non-Ionising Radiation (ONIR) defines the maximum permissible electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic radiation from fixed installations in the frequency range from 0 Hz to 300 GHz. A two-stage pro- tection concept was applied. At all accessible places, the exposure limit value, which corresponds to the recommendations of the WHO, must be observed. In order to take account of the precau - tionary principle required in Switzerland under the Environ - mental Protection Act, values which are ten times stricter were set as a precautionary measure for places which are heavily used where people stay for long periods of time, based on tech - nical feasibility and economic viability.Radiation: Radiation is a form of energy that propagates as elec - tromagnetic waves. A distinction is made between ionising and non-ionising radiation. Ionising radiation can change the building blocks of matter such as molecules or atoms; non-ionising radiation has too little energy for this. Therefore, non-ionising radi- ation cannot change atoms or molecules. Mobile networks use non-ionising radiation. Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions resulting from own activities (e.g. from the combustion of fossil fuels for heating and mobility or from refrigerants). Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions resulting from purchased energy. Scope 3: All other GHG emissions resulting from upstream and downstream activities (e.g. in the supply chain). Scope 4: See ‘Avoided emissions’. SPOC: There is a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for each Group division in the Swisscom sustainability team. The SPOC is the point of contact for the divisions, especially the CR Champions, who in turn ensure the implementation of the CR measures. Sponsors: Members of the Group Executive Board as well as the Head of Group Communications & Responsibility are sponsors for the different strands of the sustainability strategy and con - tribute accordingly. Initiatives, standards and agreements on objectives CDP: The CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) is a non-profit organisation whose goal is for companies, communities and countries to disclose and publish their environmental data, such as climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions. Swisscom joined the CDP’s Supply Chain Programme in 2013 to create more transparency about the greenhouse gas emissions of its suppliers.SBTi and SBT: The goal of"

These targets focus on the quantity of emissions that must be reduced to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their 169 sub-goals form the core of the 2030 Agenda. They take into account the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in a bal- anced way and, for the first time, bring poverty reduction and sustainable development together into one agenda. TCFD: The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015 to develop recommendations on corporate financial trans - parency related to climate risks. These provide a framework that allows companies to correctly assess their exposure to climate risks, e.g. in order to implement the necessary strategies in their business activity. Other terms asut: Swiss Telecommunications Association (asut). asut represents the telecommunications industry. The association is committed to ensuring optimal general conditions for users and providers of services and products.
